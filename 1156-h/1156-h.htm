    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE towers of Zenith aspired above the morning mist; austere towers of
      steel and cement and limestone, sturdy as cliffs and delicate as silver
      rods. They were neither citadels nor churches, but frankly and beautifully
      office-buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist took pity on the fretted structures of earlier generations: the
      Post Office with its shingle-tortured mansard, the red brick minarets of
      hulking old houses, factories with stingy and sooted windows, wooden
      tenements colored like mud. The city was full of such grotesqueries, but
      the clean towers were thrusting them from the business center, and on the
      farther hills were shining new houses, homes&mdash;they seemed&mdash;for
      laughter and tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over a concrete bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless
      engine. These people in evening clothes were returning from an all-night
      rehearsal of a Little Theater play, an artistic adventure considerably
      illuminated by champagne. Below the bridge curved a railroad, a maze of
      green and crimson lights. The New York Flyer boomed past, and twenty lines
      of polished steel leaped into the glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the skyscrapers the wires of the Associated Press were closing
      down. The telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eye-shades
      after a night of talking with Paris and Peking. Through the building
      crawled the scrubwomen, yawning, their old shoes slapping. The dawn mist
      spun away. Cues of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of
      new factories, sheets of glass and hollow tile, glittering shops where
      five thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares
      that would be sold up the Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles
      rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the April dawn; the song of
      labor in a city built&mdash;it seemed&mdash;for giants.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was beginning
      to awaken on the sleeping-porch of a Dutch Colonial house in that
      residential district of Zenith known as Floral Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was George F. Babbitt. He was forty-six years old now, in April,
      1920, and he made nothing in particular, neither butter nor shoes nor
      poetry, but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more than
      people could afford to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      His large head was pink, his brown hair thin and dry. His face was babyish
      in slumber, despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents on the slopes
      of his nose. He was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed; his cheeks
      were pads, and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon the
      khaki-colored blanket was slightly puffy. He seemed prosperous, extremely
      married and unromantic; and altogether unromantic appeared this
      sleeping-porch, which looked on one sizable elm, two respectable
      grass-plots, a cement driveway, and a corrugated iron garage. Yet Babbitt
      was again dreaming of the fairy child, a dream more romantic than scarlet
      pagodas by a silver sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years the fairy child had come to him. Where others saw but Georgie
      Babbitt, she discerned gallant youth. She waited for him, in the darkness
      beyond mysterious groves. When at last he could slip away from the crowded
      house he darted to her. His wife, his clamoring friends, sought to follow,
      but he escaped, the girl fleet beside him, and they crouched together on a
      shadowy hillside. She was so slim, so white, so eager! She cried that he
      was gay and valiant, that she would wait for him, that they would sail&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumble and bang of the milk-truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt moaned; turned over; struggled back toward his dream. He could see
      only her face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace-man slammed the
      basement door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully
      into a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the
      rolled-up Advocate thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach
      constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar and
      irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah,
      snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen
      driver, with him waited through taut hours for the roar of the starting
      engine, with him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal
      patient snap-ah-ah&mdash;a round, flat sound, a shivering cold-morning
      sound, a sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the rising voice of
      the motor told him that the Ford was moving was he released from the
      panting tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree, elm twigs against
      the gold patina of sky, and fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had
      been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the
      possible and improbable adventures of each new day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He escaped from reality till the alarm-clock rang, at seven-twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced
      alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime,
      intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being
      awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as
      buying expensive cord tires.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and
      detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family,
      and disliked himself for disliking them. The evening before, he had played
      poker at Vergil Gunch's till midnight, and after such holidays he was
      irritable before breakfast. It may have been the tremendous home-brewed
      beer of the prohibition-era and the cigars to which that beer enticed him;
      it may have been resentment of return from this fine, bold man-world to a
      restricted region of wives and stenographers, and of suggestions not to
      smoke so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bedroom beside the sleeping-porch, his wife's detestably cheerful
      &ldquo;Time to get up, Georgie boy,&rdquo; and the itchy sound, the brisk and scratchy
      sound, of combing hairs out of a stiff brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grunted; he dragged his thick legs, in faded baby-blue pajamas, from
      under the khaki blanket; he sat on the edge of the cot, running his
      fingers through his wild hair, while his plump feet mechanically felt for
      his slippers. He looked regretfully at the blanket&mdash;forever a
      suggestion to him of freedom and heroism. He had bought it for a camping
      trip which had never come off. It symbolized gorgeous loafing, gorgeous
      cursing, virile flannel shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He creaked to his feet, groaning at the waves of pain which passed behind
      his eyeballs. Though he waited for their scorching recurrence, he looked
      blurrily out at the yard. It delighted him, as always; it was the neat
      yard of a successful business man of Zenith, that is, it was perfection,
      and made him also perfect. He regarded the corrugated iron garage. For the
      three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth time in a year he reflected, &ldquo;No class to
      that tin shack. Have to build me a frame garage. But by golly it's the
      only thing on the place that isn't up-to-date!&rdquo; While he stared he thought
      of a community garage for his acreage development, Glen Oriole. He stopped
      puffing and jiggling. His arms were akimbo. His petulant, sleep-swollen
      face was set in harder lines. He suddenly seemed capable, an official, a
      man to contrive, to direct, to get things done.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard, clean,
      unused-looking hall into the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the house was not large it had, like all houses on Floral Heights,
      an altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek
      as silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel. The tub
      was long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set bowl was a
      sensational exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush holder,
      soap-dish, sponge-dish, and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and so
      ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrument-board. But the
      Babbitt whose god was Modern Appliances was not pleased. The air of the
      bathroom was thick with the smell of a heathen toothpaste. &ldquo;Verona been at
      it again! 'Stead of sticking to Lilidol, like I've re-peat-ed-ly asked
      her, she's gone and gotten some confounded stinkum stuff that makes you
      sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bath-mat was wrinkled and the floor was wet. (His daughter Verona
      eccentrically took baths in the morning, now and then.) He slipped on the
      mat, and slid against the tub. He said &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; Furiously he snatched up
      his tube of shaving-cream, furiously he lathered, with a belligerent
      slapping of the unctuous brush, furiously he raked his plump cheeks with a
      safety-razor. It pulled. The blade was dull. He said, &ldquo;Damn&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;damn
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hunted through the medicine-cabinet for a packet of new razor-blades
      (reflecting, as invariably, &ldquo;Be cheaper to buy one of these dinguses and
      strop your own blades,&rdquo;) and when he discovered the packet, behind the
      round box of bicarbonate of soda, he thought ill of his wife for putting
      it there and very well of himself for not saying &ldquo;Damn.&rdquo; But he did say
      it, immediately afterward, when with wet and soap-slippery fingers he
      tried to remove the horrible little envelope and crisp clinging oiled
      paper from the new blade. Then there was the problem, oft-pondered, never
      solved, of what to do with the old blade, which might imperil the fingers
      of his young. As usual, he tossed it on top of the medicine-cabinet, with
      a mental note that some day he must remove the fifty or sixty other blades
      that were also temporarily, piled up there. He finished his shaving in a
      growing testiness increased by his spinning headache and by the emptiness
      in his stomach. When he was done, his round face smooth and streamy and
      his eyes stinging from soapy water, he reached for a towel. The family
      towels were wet, wet and clammy and vile, all of them wet, he found, as he
      blindly snatched them&mdash;his own face-towel, his wife's, Verona's,
      Ted's, Tinka's, and the lone bath-towel with the huge welt of initial.
      Then George F. Babbitt did a dismaying thing. He wiped his face on the
      guest-towel! It was a pansy-embroidered trifle which always hung there to
      indicate that the Babbitts were in the best Floral Heights society. No one
      had ever used it. No guest had ever dared to. Guests secretively took a
      corner of the nearest regular towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was raging, &ldquo;By golly, here they go and use up all the towels, every
      doggone one of 'em, and they use 'em and get 'em all wet and sopping, and
      never put out a dry one for me&mdash;of course, I'm the goat!&mdash;and
      then I want one and&mdash;I'm the only person in the doggone house that's
      got the slightest doggone bit of consideration for other people and
      thoughtfulness and consider there may be others that may want to use the
      doggone bathroom after me and consider&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pitching the chill abominations into the bath-tub, pleased by the
      vindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound; and in the midst his wife
      serenely trotted in, observed serenely, &ldquo;Why Georgie dear, what are you
      doing? Are you going to wash out the towels? Why, you needn't wash out the
      towels. Oh, Georgie, you didn't go and use the guest-towel, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not recorded that he was able to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to look
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Myra Babbitt&mdash;Mrs. George F. Babbitt&mdash;was definitely mature. She
      had creases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin, and
      her plump neck bagged. But the thing that marked her as having passed the
      line was that she no longer had reticences before her husband, and no
      longer worried about not having reticences. She was in a petticoat now,
      and corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets. She
      had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full
      matronliness she was as sexless as an anemic nun. She was a good woman, a
      kind woman, a diligent woman, but no one, save perhaps Tinka her
      ten-year-old, was at all interested in her or entirely aware that she was
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a rather thorough discussion of all the domestic and social aspects
      of towels she apologized to Babbitt for his having an alcoholic headache;
      and he recovered enough to endure the search for a B.V.D. undershirt which
      had, he pointed out, malevolently been concealed among his clean pajamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fairly amiable in the conference on the brown suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Myra?&rdquo; He pawed at the clothes hunched on a chair in
      their bedroom, while she moved about mysteriously adjusting and patting
      her petticoat and, to his jaundiced eye, never seeming to get on with her
      dressing. &ldquo;How about it? Shall I wear the brown suit another day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it looks awfully nice on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but gosh, it needs pressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. Perhaps it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly could stand being pressed, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, perhaps it wouldn't hurt it to be pressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But gee, the coat doesn't need pressing. No sense in having the whole
      darn suit pressed, when the coat doesn't need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the pants certainly need it, all right. Look at them&mdash;look at
      those wrinkles&mdash;the pants certainly do need pressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. Oh, Georgie, why couldn't you wear the brown coat with the
      blue trousers we were wondering what we'd do with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Did you ever in all my life know me to wear the coat of one
      suit and the pants of another? What do you think I am? A busted
      bookkeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you put on the dark gray suit to-day, and stop in at the
      tailor and leave the brown trousers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they certainly need&mdash;Now where the devil is that gray suit?
      Oh, yes, here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was able to get through the other crises of dressing with comparative
      resoluteness and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first adornment was the sleeveless dimity B.V.D. undershirt, in which
      he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard at a
      civic pageant. He never put on B.V.D.'s without thanking the God of
      Progress that he didn't wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments,
      like his father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second
      embellishment was combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a
      tremendous forehead, arching up two inches beyond the former hair-line.
      But most wonder-working of all was the donning of his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is character in spectacles&mdash;the pretentious tortoiseshell, the
      meek pince-nez of the school teacher, the twisted silver-framed glasses of
      the old villager. Babbitt's spectacles had huge, circular, frameless
      lenses of the very best glass; the ear-pieces were thin bars of gold. In
      them he was the modern business man; one who gave orders to clerks and
      drove a car and played occasional golf and was scholarly in regard to
      Salesmanship. His head suddenly appeared not babyish but weighty, and you
      noted his heavy, blunt nose, his straight mouth and thick, long upper lip,
      his chin overfleshy but strong; with respect you beheld him put on the
      rest of his uniform as a Solid Citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray suit was well cut, well made, and completely undistinguished. It
      was a standard suit. White piping on the V of the vest added a flavor of
      law and learning. His shoes were black laced boots, good boots, honest
      boots, standard boots, extraordinarily uninteresting boots. The only
      frivolity was in his purple knitted scarf. With considerable comment on
      the matter to Mrs. Babbitt (who, acrobatically fastening the back of her
      blouse to her skirt with a safety-pin, did not hear a word he said), he
      chose between the purple scarf and a tapestry effect with stringless brown
      harps among blown palms, and into it he thrust a snake-head pin with opal
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sensational event was changing from the brown suit to the gray the
      contents of his pockets. He was earnest about these objects. They were of
      eternal importance, like baseball or the Republican Party. They included a
      fountain pen and a silver pencil (always lacking a supply of new leads)
      which belonged in the righthand upper vest pocket. Without them he would
      have felt naked. On his watch-chain were a gold penknife, silver
      cigar-cutter, seven keys (the use of two of which he had forgotten), and
      incidentally a good watch. Depending from the chain was a large, yellowish
      elk's-tooth-proclamation of his membership in the Brotherly and Protective
      Order of Elks. Most significant of all was his loose-leaf pocket
      note-book, that modern and efficient note-book which contained the
      addresses of people whom he had forgotten, prudent memoranda of postal
      money-orders which had reached their destinations months ago, stamps which
      had lost their mucilage, clippings of verses by T. Cholmondeley Frink and
      of the newspaper editorials from which Babbitt got his opinions and his
      polysyllables, notes to be sure and do things which he did not intend to
      do, and one curious inscription&mdash;D.S.S. D.M.Y.P.D.F.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no cigarette-case. No one had ever happened to give him one, so
      he hadn't the habit, and people who carried cigarette-cases he regarded as
      effeminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last, he stuck in his lapel the Boosters' Club button. With the
      conciseness of great art the button displayed two words: &ldquo;Boosters-Pep!&rdquo;
       It made Babbitt feel loyal and important. It associated him with Good
      Fellows, with men who were nice and human, and important in business
      circles. It was his V.C., his Legion of Honor ribbon, his Phi Beta Kappa
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the subtleties of dressing ran other complex worries. &ldquo;I feel kind of
      punk this morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I had too much dinner last evening.
      You oughtn't to serve those heavy banana fritters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you asked me to have some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but&mdash;I tell you, when a fellow gets past forty he has to
      look after his digestion. There's a lot of fellows that don't take proper
      care of themselves. I tell you at forty a man's a fool or his doctor&mdash;I
      mean, his own doctor. Folks don't give enough attention to this matter of
      dieting. Now I think&mdash;Course a man ought to have a good meal after
      the day's work, but it would be a good thing for both of us if we took
      lighter lunches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Georgie, here at home I always do have a light lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean to imply I make a hog of myself, eating down-town? Yes, sure! You'd
      have a swell time if you had to eat the truck that new steward hands out
      to us at the Athletic Club! But I certainly do feel out of sorts, this
      morning. Funny, got a pain down here on the left side&mdash;but no, that
      wouldn't be appendicitis, would it? Last night, when I was driving over to
      Verg Gunch's, I felt a pain in my stomach, too. Right here it was&mdash;kind
      of a sharp shooting pain. I&mdash;Where'd that dime go to? Why don't you
      serve more prunes at breakfast? Of course I eat an apple every evening&mdash;an
      apple a day keeps the doctor away&mdash;but still, you ought to have more
      prunes, and not all these fancy doodads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last time I had prunes you didn't eat them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't feel like eating 'em, I suppose. Matter of fact, I think I
      did eat some of 'em. Anyway&mdash;I tell you it's mighty important to&mdash;I
      was saying to Verg Gunch, just last evening, most people don't take
      sufficient care of their diges&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we have the Gunches for our dinner, next week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why sure; you bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here, George: I want you to put on your nice dinner-jacket that
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats! The rest of 'em won't want to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they will. You remember when you didn't dress for the
      Littlefields' supper-party, and all the rest did, and how embarrassed you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Embarrassed, hell! I wasn't embarrassed. Everybody knows I can put on as
      expensive a Tux. as anybody else, and I should worry if I don't happen to
      have it on sometimes. All a darn nuisance, anyway. All right for a woman,
      that stays around the house all the time, but when a fellow's worked like
      the dickens all day, he doesn't want to go and hustle his head off getting
      into the soup-and-fish for a lot of folks that he's seen in just reg'lar
      ordinary clothes that same day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you enjoy being seen in one. The other evening you admitted you
      were glad I'd insisted on your dressing. You said you felt a lot better
      for it. And oh, Georgie, I do wish you wouldn't say 'Tux.' It's
      'dinner-jacket.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats, what's the odds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's what all the nice folks say. Suppose Lucile McKelvey heard you
      calling it a 'Tux.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all right now! Lucile McKelvey can't pull anything on me!
      Her folks are common as mud, even if her husband and her dad are
      millionaires! I suppose you're trying to rub in your exalted social
      position! Well, let me tell you that your revered paternal ancestor, Henry
      T., doesn't even call it a 'Tux.'! He calls it a 'bobtail jacket for a
      ringtail monkey,' and you couldn't get him into one unless you
      chloroformed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't be horrid, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want to be horrid, but Lord! you're getting as fussy as
      Verona. Ever since she got out of college she's been too rambunctious to
      live with&mdash;doesn't know what she wants&mdash;well, I know what she
      wants!&mdash;all she wants is to marry a millionaire, and live in Europe,
      and hold some preacher's hand, and simultaneously at the same time stay
      right here in Zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator or
      boss charity-worker or some damn thing! Lord, and Ted is just as bad! He
      wants to go to college, and he doesn't want to go to college. Only one of
      the three that knows her own mind is Tinka. Simply can't understand how I
      ever came to have a pair of shillyshallying children like Rone and Ted. I
      may not be any Rockefeller or James J. Shakespeare, but I certainly do
      know my own mind, and I do keep right on plugging along in the office and&mdash;Do
      you know the latest? Far as I can figure out, Ted's new bee is he'd like
      to be a movie actor and&mdash;And here I've told him a hundred times, if
      he'll go to college and law-school and make good, I'll set him up in
      business and&mdash;Verona just exactly as bad. Doesn't know what she
      wants. Well, well, come on! Aren't you ready yet? The girl rang the bell
      three minutes ago.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Before he followed his wife, Babbitt stood at the westernmost window of
      their room. This residential settlement, Floral Heights, was on a rise;
      and though the center of the city was three miles away&mdash;Zenith had
      between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants now&mdash;he could see
      the top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana limestone building of
      thirty-five stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its shining walls rose against April sky to a simple cornice like a streak
      of white fire. Integrity was in the tower, and decision. It bore its
      strength lightly as a tall soldier. As Babbitt stared, the nervousness was
      soothed from his face, his slack chin lifted in reverence. All he
      articulated was &ldquo;That's one lovely sight!&rdquo; but he was inspired by the
      rhythm of the city; his love of it renewed. He beheld the tower as a
      temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted,
      surpassing common men; and as he clumped down to breakfast he whistled the
      ballad &ldquo;Oh, by gee, by gosh, by jingo&rdquo; as though it were a hymn melancholy
      and noble.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      RELIEVED of Babbitt's bumbling and the soft grunts with which his wife
      expressed the sympathy she was too experienced to feel and much too
      experienced not to show, their bedroom settled instantly into
      impersonality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave on the sleeping-porch. It served both of them as dressing-room,
      and on the coldest nights Babbitt luxuriously gave up the duty of being
      manly and retreated to the bed inside, to curl his toes in the warmth and
      laugh at the January gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room displayed a modest and pleasant color-scheme, after one of the
      best standard designs of the decorator who &ldquo;did the interiors&rdquo; for most of
      the speculative-builders' houses in Zenith. The walls were gray, the
      woodwork white, the rug a serene blue; and very much like mahogany was the
      furniture&mdash;the bureau with its great clear mirror, Mrs. Babbitt's
      dressing-table with toilet-articles of almost solid silver, the plain twin
      beds, between them a small table holding a standard electric bedside lamp,
      a glass for water, and a standard bedside book with colored illustrations&mdash;what
      particular book it was cannot be ascertained, since no one had ever opened
      it. The mattresses were firm but not hard, triumphant modern mattresses
      which had cost a great deal of money; the hot-water radiator was of
      exactly the proper scientific surface for the cubic contents of the room.
      The windows were large and easily opened, with the best catches and cords,
      and Holland roller-shades guaranteed not to crack. It was a masterpiece
      among bedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium Incomes.
      Only it had nothing to do with the Babbitts, nor with any one else. If
      people had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and lain
      in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of it. It
      had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel. One expected
      the chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who would stay but
      one night, go without looking back, and never think of it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every second house in Floral Heights had a bedroom precisely like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Babbitts' house was five years old. It was all as competent and glossy
      as this bedroom. It had the best of taste, the best of inexpensive rugs, a
      simple and laudable architecture, and the latest conveniences. Throughout,
      electricity took the place of candles and slatternly hearth-fires. Along
      the bedroom baseboard were three plugs for electric lamps, concealed by
      little brass doors. In the halls were plugs for the vacuum cleaner, and in
      the living-room plugs for the piano lamp, for the electric fan. The trim
      dining-room (with its admirable oak buffet, its leaded-glass cupboard, its
      creamy plaster walls, its modest scene of a salmon expiring upon a pile of
      oysters) had plugs which supplied the electric percolator and the electric
      toaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact there was but one thing wrong with the Babbitt house: It was not a
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Often of a morning Babbitt came bouncing and jesting in to breakfast. But
      things were mysteriously awry to-day. As he pontifically tread the upper
      hall he looked into Verona's bedroom and protested, &ldquo;What's the use of
      giving the family a high-class house when they don't appreciate it and
      tend to business and get down to brass tacks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He marched upon them: Verona, a dumpy brown-haired girl of twenty-two,
      just out of Bryn Mawr, given to solicitudes about duty and sex and God and
      the unconquerable bagginess of the gray sports-suit she was now wearing.
      Ted&mdash;Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt&mdash;a decorative boy of seventeen.
      Tinka&mdash;Katherine&mdash;still a baby at ten, with radiant red hair and
      a thin skin which hinted of too much candy and too many ice cream sodas.
      Babbitt did not show his vague irritation as he tramped in. He really
      disliked being a family tyrant, and his nagging was as meaningless as it
      was frequent. He shouted at Tinka, &ldquo;Well, kittiedoolie!&rdquo; It was the only
      pet name in his vocabulary, except the &ldquo;dear&rdquo; and &ldquo;hon.&rdquo; with which he
      recognized his wife, and he flung it at Tinka every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gulped a cup of coffee in the hope of pacifying his stomach and his
      soul. His stomach ceased to feel as though it did not belong to him, but
      Verona began to be conscientious and annoying, and abruptly there returned
      to Babbitt the doubts regarding life and families and business which had
      clawed at him when his dream-life and the slim fairy girl had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verona had for six months been filing-clerk at the Gruensberg Leather
      Company offices, with a prospect of becoming secretary to Mr. Gruensberg
      and thus, as Babbitt defined it, &ldquo;getting some good out of your expensive
      college education till you're ready to marry and settle down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now said Verona: &ldquo;Father! I was talking to a classmate of mine that's
      working for the Associated Charities&mdash;oh, Dad, there's the sweetest
      little babies that come to the milk-station there!&mdash;and I feel as
      though I ought to be doing something worth while like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean 'worth while'? If you get to be Gruensberg's secretary&mdash;and
      maybe you would, if you kept up your shorthand and didn't go sneaking off
      to concerts and talkfests every evening&mdash;I guess you'll find
      thirty-five or forty bones a week worth while!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but&mdash;oh, I want to&mdash;contribute&mdash;I wish I were
      working in a settlement-house. I wonder if I could get one of the
      department-stores to let me put in a welfare-department with a nice
      rest-room and chintzes and wicker chairs and so on and so forth. Or I
      could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you look here! The first thing you got to understand is that all this
      uplift and flipflop and settlement-work and recreation is nothing in God's
      world but the entering wedge for socialism. The sooner a man learns he
      isn't going to be coddled, and he needn't expect a lot of free grub and,
      uh, all these free classes and flipflop and doodads for his kids unless he
      earns 'em, why, the sooner he'll get on the job and produce&mdash;produce&mdash;produce!
      That's what the country needs, and not all this fancy stuff that just
      enfeebles the will-power of the working man and gives his kids a lot of
      notions above their class. And you&mdash;if you'd tend to business instead
      of fooling and fussing&mdash;All the time! When I was a young man I made
      up my mind what I wanted to do, and stuck to it through thick and thin,
      and that's why I'm where I am to-day, and&mdash;Myra! What do you let the
      girl chop the toast up into these dinky little chunks for? Can't get your
      fist onto 'em. Half cold, anyway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making
      hiccup-like sounds of interruption. He blurted now, &ldquo;Say, Rone, you going
      to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verona whirled. &ldquo;Ted! Will you kindly not interrupt us when we're talking
      about serious matters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw punk,&rdquo; said Ted judicially. &ldquo;Ever since somebody slipped up and let
      you out of college, Ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations
      about what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths. Are you going to&mdash;I want to
      use the car tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt snorted, &ldquo;Oh, you do! May want it myself!&rdquo; Verona protested, &ldquo;Oh,
      you do, Mr. Smarty! I'm going to take it myself!&rdquo; Tinka wailed, &ldquo;Oh, papa,
      you said maybe you'd drive us down to Rosedale!&rdquo; and Mrs. Babbitt,
      &ldquo;Careful, Tinka, your sleeve is in the butter.&rdquo; They glared, and Verona
      hurled, &ldquo;Ted, you're a perfect pig about the car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course you're not! Not a-tall!&rdquo; Ted could be maddeningly bland. &ldquo;You just
      want to grab it off, right after dinner, and leave it in front of some
      skirt's house all evening while you sit and gas about lite'ature and the
      highbrows you're going to marry&mdash;if they only propose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dad oughtn't to EVER let you have it! You and those beastly Jones
      boys drive like maniacs. The idea of your taking the turn on Chautauqua
      Place at forty miles an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, where do you get that stuff! You're so darn scared of the car that
      you drive up-hill with the emergency brake on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not! And you&mdash;Always talking about how much you know about
      motors, and Eunice Littlefield told me you said the battery fed the
      generator!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;why, my good woman, you don't know a generator from a
      differential.&rdquo; Not unreasonably was Ted lofty with her. He was a natural
      mechanic, a maker and tinkerer of machines; he lisped in blueprints for
      the blueprints came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do now!&rdquo; Babbitt flung in mechanically, as he lighted the
      gloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating
      drug of the Advocate-Times headlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted negotiated: &ldquo;Gee, honest, Rone, I don't want to take the old boat, but
      I promised couple o' girls in my class I'd drive 'em down to the rehearsal
      of the school chorus, and, gee, I don't want to, but a gentleman's got to
      keep his social engagements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word! You and your social engagements! In high school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ain't we select since we went to that hen college! Let me tell you
      there isn't a private school in the state that's got as swell a bunch as
      we got in Gamma Digamma this year. There's two fellows that their dads are
      millionaires. Say, gee, I ought to have a car of my own, like lots of the
      fellows.&rdquo; Babbitt almost rose. &ldquo;A car of your own! Don't you want a yacht,
      and a house and lot? That pretty nearly takes the cake! A boy that can't
      pass his Latin examinations, like any other boy ought to, and he expects
      me to give him a motor-car, and I suppose a chauffeur, and an areoplane
      maybe, as a reward for the hard work he puts in going to the movies with
      Eunice Littlefield! Well, when you see me giving you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat later, after diplomacies, Ted persuaded Verona to admit that she
      was merely going to the Armory, that evening, to see the dog and cat show.
      She was then, Ted planned, to park the car in front of the candy-store
      across from the Armory and he would pick it up. There were masterly
      arrangements regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline tank
      filled; and passionately, devotees of the Great God Motor, they hymned the
      patch on the spare inner-tube, and the lost jack-handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their truce dissolving, Ted observed that her friends were &ldquo;a scream of a
      bunch-stuck-up gabby four-flushers.&rdquo; His friends, she indicated, were
      &ldquo;disgusting imitation sports, and horrid little shrieking ignorant girls.&rdquo;
       Further: &ldquo;It's disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes, and so on and so
      forth, and those clothes you've got on this morning, they're too utterly
      ridiculous&mdash;honestly, simply disgusting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted balanced over to the low beveled mirror in the buffet, regarded his
      charms, and smirked. His suit, the latest thing in Old Eli Togs, was
      skin-tight, with skimpy trousers to the tops of his glaring tan boots, a
      chorus-man waistline, pattern of an agitated check, and across the back a
      belt which belted nothing. His scarf was an enormous black silk wad. His
      flaxen hair was ice-smooth, pasted back without parting. When he went to
      school he would add a cap with a long vizor like a shovel-blade. Proudest
      of all was his waistcoat, saved for, begged for, plotted for; a real Fancy
      Vest of fawn with polka dots of a decayed red, the points astoundingly
      long. On the lower edge of it he wore a high-school button, a class
      button, and a fraternity pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And none of it mattered. He was supple and swift and flushed; his eyes
      (which he believed to be cynical) were candidly eager. But he was not
      over-gentle. He waved his hand at poor dumpy Verona and drawled: &ldquo;Yes, I
      guess we're pretty ridiculous and disgusticulus, and I rather guess our
      new necktie is some smear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt barked: &ldquo;It is! And while you're admiring yourself, let me tell
      you it might add to your manly beauty if you wiped some of that egg off
      your mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verona giggled, momentary victor in the greatest of Great Wars, which is
      the family war. Ted looked at her hopelessly, then shrieked at Tinka: &ldquo;For
      the love o' Pete, quit pouring the whole sugar bowl on your corn flakes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Verona and Ted were gone and Tinka upstairs, Babbitt groaned to his
      wife: &ldquo;Nice family, I must say! I don't pretend to be any baa-lamb, and
      maybe I'm a little cross-grained at breakfast sometimes, but the way they
      go on jab-jab-jabbering, I simply can't stand it. I swear, I feel like
      going off some place where I can get a little peace. I do think after a
      man's spent his lifetime trying to give his kids a chance and a decent
      education, it's pretty discouraging to hear them all the time scrapping
      like a bunch of hyenas and never&mdash;and never&mdash;Curious; here in
      the paper it says&mdash;Never silent for one mom&mdash;Seen the morning
      paper yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo; In twenty-three years of married life, Mrs. Babbitt had seen
      the paper before her husband just sixty-seven times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of news. Terrible big tornado in the South. Hard luck, all right.
      But this, say, this is corking! Beginning of the end for those fellows!
      New York Assembly has passed some bills that ought to completely outlaw
      the socialists! And there's an elevator-runners' strike in New York and a
      lot of college boys are taking their places. That's the stuff! And a
      mass-meeting in Birmingham's demanded that this Mick agitator, this fellow
      De Valera, be deported. Dead right, by golly! All these agitators paid
      with German gold anyway. And we got no business interfering with the Irish
      or any other foreign government. Keep our hands strictly off. And there's
      another well-authenticated rumor from Russia that Lenin is dead. That's
      fine. It's beyond me why we don't just step in there and kick those
      Bolshevik cusses out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it says here a fellow was inaugurated mayor in overalls&mdash;a
      preacher, too! What do you think of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He searched for an attitude, but neither as a Republican, a Presbyterian,
      an Elk, nor a real-estate broker did he have any doctrine about
      preacher-mayors laid down for him, so he grunted and went on. She looked
      sympathetic and did not hear a word. Later she would read the headlines,
      the society columns, and the department-store advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about this! Charley McKelvey still doing the sassiety
      stunt as heavy as ever. Here's what that gushy woman reporter says about
      last night:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never is Society with the big, big S more flattered than when they are
      bidden to partake of good cheer at the distinguished and hospitable
      residence of Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. McKelvey as they were last night. Set
      in its spacious lawns and landscaping, one of the notable sights crowning
      Royal Ridge, but merry and homelike despite its mighty stone walls and its
      vast rooms famed for their decoration, their home was thrown open last
      night for a dance in honor of Mrs. McKelvey's notable guest, Miss J.
      Sneeth of Washington. The wide hall is so generous in its proportions that
      it made a perfect ballroom, its hardwood floor reflecting the charming
      pageant above its polished surface. Even the delights of dancing paled
      before the alluring opportunities for tete-a-tetes that invited the soul
      to loaf in the long library before the baronial fireplace, or in the
      drawing-room with its deep comfy armchairs, its shaded lamps just made for
      a sly whisper of pretty nothings all a deux; or even in the billiard room
      where one could take a cue and show a prowess at still another game than
      that sponsored by Cupid and Terpsichore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more, a great deal more, in the best urban journalistic style of
      Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, the popular society editor of the Advocate-Times.
      But Babbitt could not abide it. He grunted. He wrinkled the newspaper. He
      protested: &ldquo;Can you beat it! I'm willing to hand a lot of credit to
      Charley McKelvey. When we were in college together, he was just as hard up
      as any of us, and he's made a million good bucks out of contracting and
      hasn't been any dishonester or bought any more city councils than was
      necessary. And that's a good house of his&mdash;though it ain't any
      'mighty stone walls' and it ain't worth the ninety thousand it cost him.
      But when it comes to talking as though Charley McKelvey and all that
      booze-hoisting set of his are any blooming bunch of of, of Vanderbilts,
      why, it makes me tired!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Timidly from Mrs. Babbitt: &ldquo;I would like to see the inside of their house
      though. It must be lovely. I've never been inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have! Lots of&mdash;couple of times. To see Chaz about business
      deals, in the evening. It's not so much. I wouldn't WANT to go there to
      dinner with that gang of, of high-binders. And I'll bet I make a whole lot
      more money than some of those tin-horns that spend all they got on
      dress-suits and haven't got a decent suit of underwear to their name! Hey!
      What do you think of this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt was strangely unmoved by the tidings from the Real Estate and
      Building column of the Advocate-Times:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ashtabula Street, 496&mdash;J. K. Dawson to
     Thomas Mullally, April 17, 15.7 X 112.2,
     mtg. $4000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . Nom
</pre>
    <p>
      And this morning Babbitt was too disquieted to entertain her with items
      from Mechanics' Liens, Mortgages Recorded, and Contracts Awarded. He rose.
      As he looked at her his eyebrows seemed shaggier than usual. Suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, maybe&mdash;Kind of shame to not keep in touch with folks like the
      McKelveys. We might try inviting them to dinner, some evening. Oh,
      thunder, let's not waste our good time thinking about 'em! Our little
      bunch has a lot liver times than all those plutes. Just compare a real
      human like you with these neurotic birds like Lucile McKelvey&mdash;all
      highbrow talk and dressed up like a plush horse! You're a great old girl,
      hon.!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He covered his betrayal of softness with a complaining: &ldquo;Say, don't let
      Tinka go and eat any more of that poison nutfudge. For Heaven's sake, try
      to keep her from ruining her digestion. I tell you, most folks don't
      appreciate how important it is to have a good digestion and regular
      habits. Be back 'bout usual time, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her&mdash;he didn't quite kiss her&mdash;he laid unmoving lips
      against her unflushing cheek. He hurried out to the garage, muttering:
      &ldquo;Lord, what a family! And now Myra is going to get pathetic on me because
      we don't train with this millionaire outfit. Oh, Lord, sometimes I'd like
      to quit the whole game. And the office worry and detail just as bad. And I
      act cranky and&mdash;I don't mean to, but I get&mdash;So darn tired!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      To George F. Babbitt, as to most prosperous citizens of Zenith, his motor
      car was poetry and tragedy, love and heroism. The office was his pirate
      ship but the car his perilous excursion ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the tremendous crises of each day none was more dramatic than
      starting the engine. It was slow on cold mornings; there was the long,
      anxious whirr of the starter; and sometimes he had to drip ether into the
      cocks of the cylinders, which was so very interesting that at lunch he
      would chronicle it drop by drop, and orally calculate how much each drop
      had cost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning he was darkly prepared to find something wrong, and he felt
      belittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong, and the car didn't
      even brush the door-jamb, gouged and splintery with many bruisings by
      fenders, as he backed out of the garage. He was confused. He shouted
      &ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; to Sam Doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's green and white Dutch Colonial house was one of three in that
      block on Chatham Road. To the left of it was the residence of Mr. Samuel
      Doppelbrau, secretary of an excellent firm of bathroom-fixture jobbers.
      His was a comfortable house with no architectural manners whatever; a
      large wooden box with a squat tower, a broad porch, and glossy paint
      yellow as a yolk. Babbitt disapproved of Mr. and Mrs. Doppelbrau as
      &ldquo;Bohemian.&rdquo; From their house came midnight music and obscene laughter;
      there were neighborhood rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor rides.
      They furnished Babbitt with many happy evenings of discussion, during
      which he announced firmly, &ldquo;I'm not strait-laced, and I don't mind seeing
      a fellow throw in a drink once in a while, but when it comes to
      deliberately trying to get away with a lot of hell-raising all the while
      like the Doppelbraus do, it's too rich for my blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of Babbitt lived Howard Littlefield, Ph.D., in a
      strictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry brick,
      with a leaded oriel, the upper part of pale stucco like spattered clay,
      and the roof red-tiled. Littlefield was the Great Scholar of the
      neighborhood; the authority on everything in the world except babies,
      cooking, and motors. He was a Bachelor of Arts of Blodgett College, and a
      Doctor of Philosophy in economics of Yale. He was the employment-manager
      and publicity-counsel of the Zenith Street Traction Company. He could, on
      ten hours' notice, appear before the board of aldermen or the state
      legislature and prove, absolutely, with figures all in rows and with
      precedents from Poland and New Zealand, that the street-car company loved
      the Public and yearned over its employees; that all its stock was owned by
      Widows and Orphans; and that whatever it desired to do would benefit
      property-owners by increasing rental values, and help the poor by lowering
      rents. All his acquaintances turned to Littlefield when they desired to
      know the date of the battle of Saragossa, the definition of the word
      &ldquo;sabotage,&rdquo; the future of the German mark, the translation of &ldquo;hinc illae
      lachrimae,&rdquo; or the number of products of coal tar. He awed Babbitt by
      confessing that he often sat up till midnight reading the figures and
      footnotes in Government reports, or skimming (with amusement at the
      author's mistakes) the latest volumes of chemistry, archeology, and
      ichthyology.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. Despite his
      strange learnings he was as strict a Presbyterian and as firm a Republican
      as George F. Babbitt. He confirmed the business men in the faith. Where
      they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of industry and
      manners was perfect, Dr. Howard Littlefield proved it to them, out of
      history, economics, and the confessions of reformed radicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a
      savant, and in Ted's intimacy with Eunice Littlefield. At sixteen Eunice
      was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and salaries
      of motion-picture stars, but&mdash;as Babbitt definitively put it&mdash;&ldquo;she
      was her father's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The difference between a light man like Sam Doppelbrau and a really fine
      character like Littlefield was revealed in their appearances. Doppelbrau
      was disturbingly young for a man of forty-eight. He wore his derby on the
      back of his head, and his red face was wrinkled with meaningless laughter.
      But Littlefield was old for a man of forty-two. He was tall, broad, thick;
      his gold-rimmed spectacles were engulfed in the folds of his long face;
      his hair was a tossed mass of greasy blackness; he puffed and rumbled as
      he talked; his Phi Beta Kappa key shone against a spotty black vest; he
      smelled of old pipes; he was altogether funereal and archidiaconal; and to
      real-estate brokerage and the jobbing of bathroom-fixtures he added an
      aroma of sanctity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning he was in front of his house, inspecting the grass parking
      between the curb and the broad cement sidewalk. Babbitt stopped his car
      and leaned out to shout &ldquo;Mornin'!&rdquo; Littlefield lumbered over and stood
      with one foot up on the running-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine morning,&rdquo; said Babbitt, lighting&mdash;illegally early&mdash;his
      second cigar of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's a mighty fine morning,&rdquo; said Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring coming along fast now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's real spring now, all right,&rdquo; said Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still cold nights, though. Had to have a couple blankets, on the
      sleeping-porch last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it wasn't any too warm last night,&rdquo; said Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't anticipate we'll have any more real cold weather now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but still, there was snow at Tiflis, Montana, yesterday,&rdquo; said the
      Scholar, &ldquo;and you remember the blizzard they had out West three days ago&mdash;thirty
      inches of snow at Greeley, Colorado&mdash;and two years ago we had a
      snow-squall right here in Zenith on the twenty-fifth of April.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a fact! Say, old man, what do you think about the Republican
      candidate? Who'll they nominate for president? Don't you think it's about
      time we had a real business administration?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, what the country needs, first and foremost, is a good,
      sound, business-like conduct of its affairs. What we need is&mdash;a
      business administration!&rdquo; said Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear you say that! I certainly am glad to hear you say that!
      I didn't know how you'd feel about it, with all your associations with
      colleges and so on, and I'm glad you feel that way. What the country needs&mdash;just
      at this present juncture&mdash;is neither a college president nor a lot of
      monkeying with foreign affairs, but a good&mdash;sound economical&mdash;business&mdash;administration,
      that will give us a chance to have something like a decent turnover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It isn't generally realized that even in China the schoolmen are
      giving way to more practical men, and of course you can see what that
      implies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a fact! Well, well!&rdquo; breathed Babbitt, feeling much calmer, and
      much happier about the way things were going in the world. &ldquo;Well, it's
      been nice to stop and parleyvoo a second. Guess I'll have to get down to
      the office now and sting a few clients. Well, so long, old man. See you
      tonight. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      They had labored, these solid citizens. Twenty years before, the hill on
      which Floral Heights was spread, with its bright roofs and immaculate turf
      and amazing comfort, had been a wilderness of rank second-growth elms and
      oaks and maples. Along the precise streets were still a few wooded vacant
      lots, and the fragment of an old orchard. It was brilliant to-day; the
      apple boughs were lit with fresh leaves like torches of green fire. The
      first white of cherry blossoms flickered down a gully, and robins
      clamored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt sniffed the earth, chuckled at the hysteric robins as he would
      have chuckled at kittens or at a comic movie. He was, to the eye, the
      perfect office-going executive&mdash;a well-fed man in a correct brown
      soft hat and frameless spectacles, smoking a large cigar, driving a good
      motor along a semi-suburban parkway. But in him was some genius of
      authentic love for his neighborhood, his city, his clan. The winter was
      over; the time was come for the building, the visible growth, which to him
      was glory. He lost his dawn depression; he was ruddily cheerful when he
      stopped on Smith Street to leave the brown trousers, and to have the
      gasoline-tank filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiarity of the rite fortified him: the sight of the tall red iron
      gasoline-pump, the hollow-tile and terra-cotta garage, the window full of
      the most agreeable accessories&mdash;shiny casings, spark-plugs with
      immaculate porcelain jackets tire-chains of gold and silver. He was
      flattered by the friendliness with which Sylvester Moon, dirtiest and most
      skilled of motor mechanics, came out to serve him. &ldquo;Mornin', Mr. Babbitt!&rdquo;
       said Moon, and Babbitt felt himself a person of importance, one whose name
      even busy garagemen remembered&mdash;not one of these cheap-sports flying
      around in flivvers. He admired the ingenuity of the automatic dial,
      clicking off gallon by gallon; admired the smartness of the sign: &ldquo;A fill
      in time saves getting stuck&mdash;gas to-day 31 cents&rdquo;; admired the
      rhythmic gurgle of the gasoline as it flowed into the tank, and the
      mechanical regularity with which Moon turned the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much we takin' to-day?&rdquo; asked Moon, in a manner which combined the
      independence of the great specialist, the friendliness of a familiar
      gossip, and respect for a man of weight in the community, like George F.
      Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill 'er up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who you rootin' for for Republican candidate, Mr. Babbitt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too early to make any predictions yet. After all, there's still a
      good month and two weeks&mdash;no, three weeks&mdash;must be almost three
      weeks&mdash;well, there's more than six weeks in all before the Republican
      convention, and I feel a fellow ought to keep an open mind and give all
      the candidates a show&mdash;look 'em all over and size 'em up, and then
      decide carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact, Mr. Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll tell you&mdash;and my stand on this is just the same as it was
      four years ago, and eight years ago, and it'll be my stand four years from
      now&mdash;yes, and eight years from now! What I tell everybody, and it
      can't be too generally understood, is that what we need first, last, and
      all the time is a good, sound business administration!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By golly, that's right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do those front tires look to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine! Fine! Wouldn't be much work for garages if everybody looked after
      their car the way you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do try and have some sense about it.&rdquo; Babbitt paid his bill, said
      adequately, &ldquo;Oh, keep the change,&rdquo; and drove off in an ecstasy of honest
      self-appreciation. It was with the manner of a Good Samaritan that he
      shouted at a respectable-looking man who was waiting for a trolley car,
      &ldquo;Have a lift?&rdquo; As the man climbed in Babbitt condescended, &ldquo;Going clear
      down-town? Whenever I see a fellow waiting for a trolley, I always make it
      a practice to give him a lift&mdash;unless, of course, he looks like a
      bum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish there were more folks that were so generous with their machines,&rdquo;
       dutifully said the victim of benevolence. &ldquo;Oh, no, 'tain't a question of
      generosity, hardly. Fact, I always feel&mdash;I was saying to my son just
      the other night&mdash;it's a fellow's duty to share the good things of
      this world with his neighbors, and it gets my goat when a fellow gets
      stuck on himself and goes around tooting his horn merely because he's
      charitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victim seemed unable to find the right answer. Babbitt boomed on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty punk service the Company giving us on these car-lines. Nonsense to
      only run the Portland Road cars once every seven minutes. Fellow gets
      mighty cold on a winter morning, waiting on a street corner with the wind
      nipping at his ankles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right. The Street Car Company don't care a damn what kind of a
      deal they give us. Something ought to happen to 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was alarmed. &ldquo;But still, of course it won't do to just keep
      knocking the Traction Company and not realize the difficulties they're
      operating under, like these cranks that want municipal ownership. The way
      these workmen hold up the Company for high wages is simply a crime, and of
      course the burden falls on you and me that have to pay a seven-cent fare!
      Fact, there's remarkable service on all their lines&mdash;considering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darn fine morning,&rdquo; Babbitt explained. &ldquo;Spring coming along fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's real spring now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victim had no originality, no wit, and Babbitt fell into a great
      silence and devoted himself to the game of beating trolley cars to the
      corner: a spurt, a tail-chase, nervous speeding between the huge yellow
      side of the trolley and the jagged row of parked motors, shooting past
      just as the trolley stopped&mdash;a rare game and valiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while he was conscious of the loveliness of Zenith. For weeks
      together he noticed nothing but clients and the vexing To Rent signs of
      rival brokers. To-day, in mysterious malaise, he raged or rejoiced with
      equal nervous swiftness, and to-day the light of spring was so winsome
      that he lifted his head and saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He admired each district along his familiar route to the office: The
      bungalows and shrubs and winding irregular drive ways of Floral Heights.
      The one-story shops on Smith Street, a glare of plate-glass and new yellow
      brick; groceries and laundries and drug-stores to supply the more
      immediate needs of East Side housewives. The market gardens in Dutch
      Hollow, their shanties patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors.
      Billboards with crimson goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema films,
      pipe tobacco, and talcum powder. The old &ldquo;mansions&rdquo; along Ninth Street, S.
      E., like aged dandies in filthy linen; wooden castles turned into
      boarding-houses, with muddy walks and rusty hedges, jostled by
      fast-intruding garages, cheap apartment-houses, and fruit-stands conducted
      by bland, sleek Athenians. Across the belt of railroad-tracks, factories
      with high-perched water-tanks and tall stacks-factories producing
      condensed milk, paper boxes, lighting-fixtures, motor cars. Then the
      business center, the thickening darting traffic, the crammed trolleys
      unloading, and high doorways of marble and polished granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was big&mdash;and Babbitt respected bigness in anything; in mountains,
      jewels, muscles, wealth, or words. He was, for a spring-enchanted moment,
      the lyric and almost unselfish lover of Zenith. He thought of the outlying
      factory suburbs; of the Chaloosa River with its strangely eroded banks; of
      the orchard-dappled Tonawanda Hills to the North, and all the fat dairy
      land and big barns and comfortable herds. As he dropped his passenger he
      cried, &ldquo;Gosh, I feel pretty good this morning!&rdquo; III
    </p>
    <p>
      Epochal as starting the car was the drama of parking it before he entered
      his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the corner into Third
      Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space in the line of parked cars. He
      angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it. Ahead, another
      car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up, holding out his hand to
      the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly motioning an old woman to
      go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side. With
      front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of the car in front, he
      stopped, feverishly cramped his steering-wheel, slid back into the vacant
      space and, with eighteen inches of room, manoeuvered to bring the car
      level with the curb. It was a virile adventure masterfully executed. With
      satisfaction he locked a thief-proof steel wedge on the front wheel, and
      crossed the street to his real-estate office on the ground floor of the
      Reeves Building.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reeves Building was as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a
      typewriter; fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick, with clean, upright,
      unornamented lines. It was filled with the offices of lawyers, doctors,
      agents for machinery, for emery wheels, for wire fencing, for
      mining-stock. Their gold signs shone on the windows. The entrance was too
      modern to be flamboyant with pillars; it was quiet, shrewd, neat. Along
      the Third Street side were a Western Union Telegraph Office, the Blue
      Delft Candy Shop, Shotwell's Stationery Shop, and the Babbitt-Thompson
      Realty Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt could have entered his office from the street, as customers did,
      but it made him feel an insider to go through the corridor of the building
      and enter by the back door. Thus he was greeted by the villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little unknown people who inhabited the Reeves Building corridors&mdash;elevator-runners,
      starter, engineers, superintendent, and the doubtful-looking lame man who
      conducted the news and cigar stand&mdash;were in no way city-dwellers.
      They were rustics, living in a constricted valley, interested only in one
      another and in The Building. Their Main Street was the entrance hall, with
      its stone floor, severe marble ceiling, and the inner windows of the
      shops. The liveliest place on the street was the Reeves Building Barber
      Shop, but this was also Babbitt's one embarrassment. Himself, he
      patronized the glittering Pompeian Barber Shop in the Hotel Thornleigh,
      and every time he passed the Reeves shop&mdash;ten times a day, a hundred
      times&mdash;he felt untrue to his own village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as one of the squirearchy, greeted with honorable salutations by the
      villagers, he marched into his office, and peace and dignity were upon
      him, and the morning's dissonances all unheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were heard again, immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stanley Graff, the outside salesman, was talking on the telephone with
      tragic lack of that firm manner which disciplines clients: &ldquo;Say, uh, I
      think I got just the house that would suit you&mdash;the Percival House,
      in Linton.... Oh, you've seen it. Well, how'd it strike you?... Huh?
      ...Oh,&rdquo; irresolutely, &ldquo;oh, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Babbitt marched into his private room, a coop with semi-partition of
      oak and frosted glass, at the back of the office, he reflected how hard it
      was to find employees who had his own faith that he was going to make
      sales.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were nine members of the staff, besides Babbitt and his partner and
      father-in-law, Henry Thompson, who rarely came to the office. The nine
      were Stanley Graff, the outside salesman&mdash;a youngish man given to
      cigarettes and the playing of pool; old Mat Penniman, general utility man,
      collector of rents and salesman of insurance&mdash;broken, silent, gray; a
      mystery, reputed to have been a &ldquo;crack&rdquo; real-estate man with a firm of his
      own in haughty Brooklyn; Chester Kirby Laylock, resident salesman out at
      the Glen Oriole acreage development&mdash;an enthusiastic person with a
      silky mustache and much family; Miss Theresa McGoun, the swift and rather
      pretty stenographer; Miss Wilberta Bannigan, the thick, slow, laborious
      accountant and file-clerk; and four freelance part-time commission
      salesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked from his own cage into the main room Babbitt mourned,
      &ldquo;McGoun's a good stenog., smart's a whip, but Stan Graff and all those
      bums&mdash;&rdquo; The zest of the spring morning was smothered in the stale
      office air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally he admired the office, with a pleased surprise that he should
      have created this sure lovely thing; normally he was stimulated by the
      clean newness of it and the air of bustle; but to-day it seemed flat&mdash;the
      tiled floor, like a bathroom, the ocher-colored metal ceiling, the faded
      maps on the hard plaster walls, the chairs of varnished pale oak, the
      desks and filing-cabinets of steel painted in olive drab. It was a vault,
      a steel chapel where loafing and laughter were raw sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hadn't even any satisfaction in the new water-cooler! And it was the
      very best of water-coolers, up-to-date, scientific, and right-thinking. It
      had cost a great deal of money (in itself a virtue). It possessed a
      non-conducting fiber ice-container, a porcelain water-jar (guaranteed
      hygienic), a drip-less non-clogging sanitary faucet, and machine-painted
      decorations in two tones of gold. He looked down the relentless stretch of
      tiled floor at the water-cooler, and assured himself that no tenant of the
      Reeves Building had a more expensive one, but he could not recapture the
      feeling of social superiority it had given him. He astoundingly grunted,
      &ldquo;I'd like to beat it off to the woods right now. And loaf all day. And go
      to Gunch's again to-night, and play poker, and cuss as much as I feel
      like, and drink a hundred and nine-thousand bottles of beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed; he read through his mail; he shouted &ldquo;Msgoun,&rdquo; which meant
      &ldquo;Miss McGoun&rdquo;; and began to dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was his own version of his first letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Omar Gribble, send it to his office, Miss McGoun, yours of twentieth to
      hand and in reply would say look here, Gribble, I'm awfully afraid if we
      go on shilly-shallying like this we'll just naturally lose the Allen sale,
      I had Allen up on carpet day before yesterday and got right down to cases
      and think I can assure you&mdash;uh, uh, no, change that: all my
      experience indicates he is all right, means to do business, looked into
      his financial record which is fine&mdash;that sentence seems to be a
      little balled up, Miss McGoun; make a couple sentences out of it if you
      have to, period, new paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is perfectly willing to pro rate the special assessment and strikes
      me, am dead sure there will be no difficulty in getting him to pay for
      title insurance, so now for heaven's sake let's get busy&mdash;no, make
      that: so now let's go to it and get down&mdash;no, that's enough&mdash;you
      can tie those sentences up a little better when you type 'em, Miss McGoun&mdash;your
      sincerely, etcetera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is the version of his letter which he received, typed, from Miss
      McGoun that afternoon:

</pre>
    <p>
      Omar Gribble, Esq., 376 North American Building, Zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Gribble:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your letter of the twentieth to hand. I must say I'm awfully afraid that
      if we go on shilly-shallying like this we'll just naturally lose the Allen
      sale. I had Allen up on the carpet day before yesterday, and got right
      down to cases. All my experience indicates that he means to do business. I
      have also looked into his financial record, which is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is perfectly willing to pro rate the special assessment and there will
      be no difficulty in getting him to pay for title insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      SO LET'S GO! Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      As he read and signed it, in his correct flowing business-college hand,
      Babbitt reflected, &ldquo;Now that's a good, strong letter, and clear's a bell.
      Now what the&mdash;I never told McGoun to make a third paragraph there!
      Wish she'd quit trying to improve on my dictation! But what I can't
      understand is: why can't Stan Graff or Chet Laylock write a letter like
      that? With punch! With a kick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing he dictated that morning was the fortnightly
      form-letter, to be mimeographed and sent out to a thousand &ldquo;prospects.&rdquo; It
      was diligently imitative of the best literary models of the day; of
      heart-to-heart-talk advertisements, &ldquo;sales-pulling&rdquo; letters, discourses on
      the &ldquo;development of Will-power,&rdquo; and hand-shaking house-organs, as richly
      poured forth by the new school of Poets of Business. He had painfully
      written out a first draft, and he intoned it now like a poet delicate and
      distrait:
    </p>
    <p>
      SAY, OLD MAN! I just want to know can I do you a whaleuva favor? Honest!
      No kidding! I know you're interested in getting a house, not merely a
      place where you hang up the old bonnet but a love-nest for the wife and
      kiddies&mdash;and maybe for the flivver out beyant (be sure and spell that
      b-e-y-a-n-t, Miss McGoun) the spud garden. Say, did you ever stop to think
      that we're here to save you trouble? That's how we make a living&mdash;folks
      don't pay us for our lovely beauty! Now take a look:

      hopping down your lane with the good tidings, and if we can't, we won't
      bother you. To save your time, just fill out the blank enclosed. On
      request will also send blank regarding store properties in Floral Heights,
      Silver Grove, Linton, Bellevue, and all East Side residential districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours for service,
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;Just a hint of some plums we can pick for you&mdash;some
      genuine bargains that came in to-day:
    </p>
    <p>
      SILVER GROVE.&mdash;Cute four-room California bungalow, a.m.i., garage,
      dandy shade tree, swell neighborhood, handy car line. $3700, $780 down and
      balance liberal, Babbitt-Thompson terms, cheaper than rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      DORCHESTER.&mdash;A corker! Artistic two-family house, all oak trim,
      parquet floors, lovely gas log, big porches, colonial, HEATED ALL-WEATHER
      GARAGE, a bargain at $11,250.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dictation over, with its need of sitting and thinking instead of bustling
      around and making a noise and really doing something, Babbitt sat creakily
      back in his revolving desk-chair and beamed on Miss McGoun. He was
      conscious of her as a girl, of black bobbed hair against demure cheeks. A
      longing which was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled him. While
      she waited, tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the desk-tablet, he
      half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams. He imagined their
      eyes meeting with terrifying recognition; imagined touching her lips with
      frightened reverence and&mdash;She was chirping, &ldquo;Any more, Mist'
      Babbitt?&rdquo; He grunted, &ldquo;That winds it up, I guess,&rdquo; and turned heavily
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all his wandering thoughts, they had never been more intimate than
      this. He often reflected, &ldquo;Nev' forget how old Jake Offutt said a wise
      bird never goes love-making in his own office or his own home. Start
      trouble. Sure. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In twenty-three years of married life he had peered uneasily at every
      graceful ankle, every soft shoulder; in thought he had treasured them; but
      not once had he hazarded respectability by adventuring. Now, as he
      calculated the cost of repapering the Styles house, he was restless again,
      discontented about nothing and everything, ashamed of his discontentment,
      and lonely for the fairy girl.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was a morning of artistic creation. Fifteen minutes after the purple
      prose of Babbitt's form-letter, Chester Kirby Laylock, the resident
      salesman at Glen Oriole, came in to report a sale and submit an
      advertisement. Babbitt disapproved of Laylock, who sang in choirs and was
      merry at home over games of Hearts and Old Maid. He had a tenor voice,
      wavy chestnut hair, and a mustache like a camel's-hair brush. Babbitt
      considered it excusable in a family-man to growl, &ldquo;Seen this new picture
      of the kid&mdash;husky little devil, eh?&rdquo; but Laylock's domestic
      confidences were as bubbling as a girl's.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Say, I think I got a peach of an ad for the Glen, Mr. Babbitt.
Why don't we try something in poetry? Honest, it'd have wonderful
pulling-power. Listen:

     'Mid pleasures and palaces,
     Wherever you may roam,
     You just provide the little bride
     And we'll provide the home.
</pre>
    <p>
      Do you get it? See&mdash;like 'Home Sweet Home.' Don't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, hell yes, of course I get it. But&mdash;Oh, I think we'd
      better use something more dignified and forceful, like 'We lead, others
      follow,' or 'Eventually, why not now?' Course I believe in using poetry
      and humor and all that junk when it turns the trick, but with a high-class
      restricted development like the Glen we better stick to the more dignified
      approach, see how I mean? Well, I guess that's all, this morning, Chet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      By a tragedy familiar to the world of art, the April enthusiasm of Chet
      Laylock served only to stimulate the talent of the older craftsman, George
      F. Babbitt. He grumbled to Stanley Graff, &ldquo;That tan-colored voice of
      Chet's gets on my nerves,&rdquo; yet he was aroused and in one swoop he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      DO YOU RESPECT YOUR LOVED ONES?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last sad rites of bereavement are over, do you know for certain
      that you have done your best for the Departed? You haven't unless they lie
      in the Cemetery Beautiful,
    </p>
    <p>
      LINDEN LANE
    </p>
    <p>
      the only strictly up-to-date burial place in or near Zenith, where
      exquisitely gardened plots look from daisy-dotted hill-slopes across the
      smiling fields of Dorchester.

      Cemetery something about modern merchandizing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent Mat Penniman to the recorder's office to dig out the names of the
      owners of houses which were displaying For Rent signs of other brokers; he
      talked to a man who desired to lease a store-building for a pool-room; he
      ran over the list of home-leases which were about to expire; he sent
      Thomas Bywaters, a street-car conductor who played at real estate in spare
      time, to call on side-street &ldquo;prospects&rdquo; who were unworthy the strategies
      of Stanley Graff. But he had spent his credulous excitement of creation,
      and these routine details annoyed him. One moment of heroism he had, in
      discovering a new way of stopping smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped smoking at least once a month. He went through with it like the
      solid citizen he was: admitted the evils of tobacco, courageously made
      resolves, laid out plans to check the vice, tapered off his allowance of
      cigars, and expounded the pleasures of virtuousness to every one he met.
      He did everything, in fact, except stop smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months before, by ruling out a schedule, noting down the hour and
      minute of each smoke, and ecstatically increasing the intervals between
      smokes, he had brought himself down to three cigars a day. Then he had
      lost the schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week ago he had invented a system of leaving his cigar-case and
      cigarette-box in an unused drawer at the bottom of the
      correspondence-file, in the outer office. &ldquo;I'll just naturally be ashamed
      to go poking in there all day long, making a fool of myself before my own
      employees!&rdquo; he reasoned. By the end of three days he was trained to leave
      his desk, walk to the file, take out and light a cigar, without knowing
      that he was doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning it was revealed to him that it had been too easy to open the
      file. Lock it, that was the thing! Inspired, he rushed out and locked up
      his cigars, his cigarettes, and even his box of safety matches; and the
      key to the file drawer he hid in his desk. But the crusading passion of it
      made him so tobacco-hungry that he immediately recovered the key, walked
      with forbidding dignity to the file, took out a cigar and a match&mdash;&ldquo;but
      only one match; if ole cigar goes out, it'll by golly have to stay out!&rdquo;
       Later, when the cigar did go out, he took one more match from the file,
      and when a buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleven-thirty,
      naturally he had to offer them cigars. His conscience protested, &ldquo;Why,
      you're smoking with them!&rdquo; but he bullied it, &ldquo;Oh, shut up! I'm busy now.
      Of course by-and-by&mdash;&rdquo; There was no by-and-by, yet his belief that he
      had crushed the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy. When he
      called up Paul Riesling he was, in his moral splendor, unusually eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fonder of Paul Riesling than of any one on earth except himself and
      his daughter Tinka. They had been classmates, roommates, in the State
      University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark
      slimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant
      speech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be
      petted and protected. Paul had gone into his father's business, after
      graduation; he was now a wholesaler and small manufacturer of
      prepared-paper roofing. But Babbitt strenuously believed and lengthily
      announced to the world of Good Fellows that Paul could have been a great
      violinist or painter or writer. &ldquo;Why say, the letters that boy sent me on
      his trip to the Canadian Rockies, they just absolutely make you see the
      place as if you were standing there. Believe me, he could have given any
      of these bloomin' authors a whale of a run for their money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet on the telephone they said only:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;South 343. No, no, no! I said SOUTH&mdash;South 343. Say, operator, what
      the dickens is the trouble? Can't you get me South 343? Why certainly
      they'll answer. Oh, Hello, 343? Wanta speak Mist' Riesling, Mist' Babbitt
      talking. . . 'Lo, Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'S George speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's old socks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair to middlin'. How 're you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, Paulibus. Well, what do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you been keepin' yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just stickin' round. What's up, Georgie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How 'bout lil lunch 's noon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be all right with me, I guess. Club?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh. Meet you there twelve-thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A' right. Twelve-thirty. S' long, Georgie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      His morning was not sharply marked into divisions. Interwoven with
      correspondence and advertisement-writing were a thousand nervous details:
      calls from clerks who were incessantly and hopefully seeking five
      furnished rooms and bath at sixty dollars a month; advice to Mat Penniman
      on getting money out of tenants who had no money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's virtues as a real-estate broker&mdash;as the servant of society
      in the department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors
      of food&mdash;were steadiness and diligence. He was conventionally honest,
      he kept his records of buyers and sellers complete, he had experience with
      leases and titles and an excellent memory for prices. His shoulders were
      broad enough, his voice deep enough, his relish of hearty humor strong
      enough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of Good Fellows. Yet
      his eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and
      complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned
      out by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of
      curving roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest
      axioms of economics. He serenely believed that the one purpose of the
      real-estate business was to make money for George F. Babbitt. True, it was
      a good advertisement at Boosters' Club lunches, and all the varieties of
      Annual Banquets to which Good Fellows were invited, to speak sonorously of
      Unselfish Public Service, the Broker's Obligation to Keep Inviolate the
      Trust of His Clients, and a thing called Ethics, whose nature was
      confusing but if you had it you were a High-class Realtor and if you
      hadn't you were a shyster, a piker, and a fly-by-night. These virtues
      awakened Confidence, and enabled you to handle Bigger Propositions. But
      they didn't imply that you were to be impractical and refuse to take twice
      the value of a house if a buyer was such an idiot that he didn't jew you
      down on the asking-price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt spoke well&mdash;and often&mdash;at these orgies of commercial
      righteousness about the &ldquo;realtor's function as a seer of the future
      development of the community, and as a prophetic engineer clearing the
      pathway for inevitable changes&rdquo;&mdash;which meant that a real-estate
      broker could make money by guessing which way the town would grow. This
      guessing he called Vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an address at the Boosters' Club he had admitted, &ldquo;It is at once the
      duty and the privilege of the realtor to know everything about his own
      city and its environs. Where a surgeon is a specialist on every vein and
      mysterious cell of the human body, and the engineer upon electricity in
      all its phases, or every bolt of some great bridge majestically arching
      o'er a mighty flood, the realtor must know his city, inch by inch, and all
      its faults and virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though he did know the market-price, inch by inch, of certain districts of
      Zenith, he did not know whether the police force was too large or too
      small, or whether it was in alliance with gambling and prostitution. He
      knew the means of fire-proofing buildings and the relation of
      insurance-rates to fire-proofing, but he did not know how many firemen
      there were in the city, how they were trained and paid, or how complete
      their apparatus. He sang eloquently the advantages of proximity of
      school-buildings to rentable homes, but he did not know&mdash;he did not
      know that it was worth while to know&mdash;whether the city schoolrooms
      were properly heated, lighted, ventilated, furnished; he did not know how
      the teachers were chosen; and though he chanted &ldquo;One of the boasts of
      Zenith is that we pay our teachers adequately,&rdquo; that was because he had
      read the statement in the Advocate-Times. Himself, he could not have given
      the average salary of teachers in Zenith or anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard it said that &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; in the County Jail and the Zenith
      City Prison were not very &ldquo;scientific;&rdquo; he had, with indignation at the
      criticism of Zenith, skimmed through a report in which the notorious
      pessimist Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, asserted that to throw boys
      and young girls into a bull-pen crammed with men suffering from syphilis,
      delirium tremens, and insanity was not the perfect way of educating them.
      He had controverted the report by growling, &ldquo;Folks that think a jail ought
      to be a bloomin' Hotel Thornleigh make me sick. If people don't like a
      jail, let 'em behave 'emselves and keep out of it. Besides, these reform
      cranks always exaggerate.&rdquo; That was the beginning and quite completely the
      end of his investigations into Zenith's charities and corrections; and as
      to the &ldquo;vice districts&rdquo; he brightly expressed it, &ldquo;Those are things that
      no decent man monkeys with. Besides, smatter fact, I'll tell you
      confidentially: it's a protection to our daughters and to decent women to
      have a district where tough nuts can raise cain. Keeps 'em away from our
      own homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to industrial conditions, however, Babbitt had thought a great deal,
      and his opinions may be coordinated as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good labor union is of value because it keeps out radical unions, which
      would destroy property. No one ought to be forced to belong to a union,
      however. All labor agitators who try to force men to join a union should
      be hanged. In fact, just between ourselves, there oughtn't to be any
      unions allowed at all; and as it's the best way of fighting the unions,
      every business man ought to belong to an employers'-association and to the
      Chamber of Commerce. In union there is strength. So any selfish hog who
      doesn't join the Chamber of Commerce ought to be forced to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In nothing&mdash;as the expert on whose advice families moved to new
      neighborhoods to live there for a generation&mdash;was Babbitt more
      splendidly innocent than in the science of sanitation. He did not know a
      malaria-bearing mosquito from a bat; he knew nothing about tests of
      drinking water; and in the matters of plumbing and sewage he was as
      unlearned as he was voluble. He often referred to the excellence of the
      bathrooms in the houses he sold. He was fond of explaining why it was that
      no European ever bathed. Some one had told him, when he was twenty-two,
      that all cesspools were unhealthy, and he still denounced them. If a
      client impertinently wanted him to sell a house which had a cesspool,
      Babbitt always spoke about it&mdash;before accepting the house and selling
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he laid out the Glen Oriole acreage development, when he ironed
      woodland and dipping meadow into a glenless, orioleless, sunburnt flat
      prickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets, he
      righteously put in a complete sewage-system. It made him feel superior; it
      enabled him to sneer privily at the Martin Lumsen development, Avonlea,
      which had a cesspool; and it provided a chorus for the full-page
      advertisements in which he announced the beauty, convenience, cheapness,
      and supererogatory healthfulness of Glen Oriole. The only flaw was that
      the Glen Oriole sewers had insufficient outlet, so that waste remained in
      them, not very agreeably, while the Avonlea cesspool was a Waring septic
      tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the Glen Oriole project was a suggestion that Babbitt, though
      he really did hate men recognized as swindlers, was not too unreasonably
      honest. Operators and buyers prefer that brokers should not be in
      competition with them as operators and buyers themselves, but attend to
      their clients' interests only. It was supposed that the Babbitt-Thompson
      Company were merely agents for Glen Oriole, serving the real owner, Jake
      Offutt, but the fact was that Babbitt and Thompson owned sixty-two per
      cent. of the Glen, the president and purchasing agent of the Zenith Street
      Traction Company owned twenty-eight per cent., and Jake Offutt (a
      gang-politician, a small manufacturer, a tobacco-chewing old farceur who
      enjoyed dirty politics, business diplomacy, and cheating at poker) had
      only ten per cent., which Babbitt and the Traction officials had given to
      him for &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; health inspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the
      State Transportation Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Babbitt was virtuous. He advocated, though he did not practise, the
      prohibition of alcohol; he praised, though he did not obey, the laws
      against motor-speeding; he paid his debts; he contributed to the church,
      the Red Cross, and the Y. M. C. A.; he followed the custom of his clan and
      cheated only as it was sanctified by precedent; and he never descended to
      trickery&mdash;though, as he explained to Paul Riesling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I don't mean to say that every ad I write is literally true or
      that I always believe everything I say when I give some buyer a good
      strong selling-spiel. You see&mdash;you see it's like this: In the first
      place, maybe the owner of the property exaggerated when he put it into my
      hands, and it certainly isn't my place to go proving my principal a liar!
      And then most folks are so darn crooked themselves that they expect a
      fellow to do a little lying, so if I was fool enough to never whoop the
      ante I'd get the credit for lying anyway! In self-defense I got to toot my
      own horn, like a lawyer defending a client&mdash;his bounden duty, ain't
      it, to bring out the poor dub's good points? Why, the Judge himself would
      bawl out a lawyer that didn't, even if they both knew the guy was guilty!
      But even so, I don't pad out the truth like Cecil Rountree or Thayer or
      the rest of these realtors. Fact, I think a fellow that's willing to
      deliberately up and profit by lying ought to be shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's value to his clients was rarely better shown than this morning,
      in the conference at eleven-thirty between himself, Conrad Lyte, and
      Archibald Purdy.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad Lyte was a real-estate speculator. He was a nervous speculator.
      Before he gambled he consulted bankers, lawyers, architects, contracting
      builders, and all of their clerks and stenographers who were willing to be
      cornered and give him advice. He was a bold entrepreneur, and he desired
      nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom from
      attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent. profit which,
      according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks and
      foresight. He was a stubby man with a cap-like mass of short gray curls
      and clothes which, no matter how well cut, seemed shaggy. Below his eyes
      were semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been pressed
      against them and had left an imprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly and always Lyte consulted Babbitt, and trusted in his slow
      cautiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months ago Babbitt had learned that one Archibald Purdy, a grocer in
      the indecisive residential district known as Linton, was talking of
      opening a butcher shop beside his grocery. Looking up the ownership of
      adjoining parcels of land, Babbitt found that Purdy owned his present shop
      but did not own the one available lot adjoining. He advised Conrad Lyte to
      purchase this lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an appraisal on a
      basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine thousand. The
      rents, declared Babbitt, were too low; and by waiting they could make
      Purdy come to their price. (This was Vision.) He had to bully Lyte into
      buying. His first act as agent for Lyte was to increase the rent of the
      battered store-building on the lot. The tenant said a number of rude
      things, but he paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Purdy seemed ready to buy, and his delay was going to cost him ten
      thousand extra dollars&mdash;the reward paid by the community to Mr.
      Conrad Lyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had Vision and who
      understood Talking Points, Strategic Values, Key Situations,
      Underappraisals, and the Psychology of Salesmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lyte came to the conference exultantly. He was fond of Babbitt, this
      morning, and called him &ldquo;old hoss.&rdquo; Purdy, the grocer, a long-nosed man
      and solemn, seemed to care less for Babbitt and for Vision, but Babbitt
      met him at the street door of the office and guided him toward the private
      room with affectionate little cries of &ldquo;This way, Brother Purdy!&rdquo; He took
      from the correspondence-file the entire box of cigars and forced them on
      his guests. He pushed their chairs two inches forward and three inches
      back, which gave an hospitable note, then leaned back in his desk-chair
      and looked plump and jolly. But he spoke to the weakling grocer with
      firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Brother Purdy, we been having some pretty tempting offers from
      butchers and a slew of other folks for that lot next to your store, but I
      persuaded Brother Lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the property
      first. I said to Lyte, 'It'd be a rotten shame,' I said, 'if somebody went
      and opened a combination grocery and meat market right next door and
      ruined Purdy's nice little business.' Especially&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt leaned
      forward, and his voice was harsh, &ldquo;&mdash;it would be hard luck if one of
      these cash-and-carry chain-stores got in there and started cutting prices
      below cost till they got rid of competition and forced you to the wall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Purdy snatched his thin hands from his pockets, pulled up his trousers,
      thrust his hands back into his pockets, tilted in the heavy oak chair, and
      tried to look amused, as he struggled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they're bad competition. But I guess you don't realize the Pulling
      Power that Personality has in a neighborhood business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great Babbitt smiled. &ldquo;That's so. Just as you feel, old man. We
      thought we'd give you first chance. All right then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look here!&rdquo; Purdy wailed. &ldquo;I know f'r a fact that a piece of property
      'bout same size, right near, sold for less 'n eighty-five hundred,
      'twa'n't two years ago, and here you fellows are asking me twenty-four
      thousand dollars! Why, I'd have to mortgage&mdash;I wouldn't mind so much
      paying twelve thousand but&mdash;Why good God, Mr. Babbitt, you're asking
      more 'n twice its value! And threatening to ruin me if I don't take it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purdy, I don't like your way of talking! I don't like it one little bit!
      Supposing Lyte and I were stinking enough to want to ruin any fellow
      human, don't you suppose we know it's to our own selfish interest to have
      everybody in Zenith prosperous? But all this is beside the point. Tell you
      what we'll do: We'll come down to twenty-three thousand-five thousand down
      and the rest on mortgage&mdash;and if you want to wreck the old shack and
      rebuild, I guess I can get Lyte here to loosen up for a building-mortgage
      on good liberal terms. Heavens, man, we'd be glad to oblige you! We don't
      like these foreign grocery trusts any better 'n you do! But it isn't
      reasonable to expect us to sacrifice eleven thousand or more just for
      neighborliness, IS it! How about it, Lyte? You willing to come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By warmly taking Purdy's part, Babbitt persuaded the benevolent Mr. Lyte
      to reduce his price to twenty-one thousand dollars. At the right moment
      Babbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had Miss McGoun type
      out a week ago and thrust it into Purdy's hands. He genially shook his
      fountain pen to make certain that it was flowing, handed it to Purdy, and
      approvingly watched him sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of the world was being done. Lyte had made something over nine
      thousand dollars, Babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar
      commission, Purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance, been
      provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants of
      Linton would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little higher
      than those down-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a manly battle, but after it Babbitt drooped. This was the
      only really amusing contest he had been planning. There was nothing ahead
      save details of leases, appraisals, mortgages.
    </p>
    <p>
      He muttered, &ldquo;Makes me sick to think of Lyte carrying off most of the
      profit when I did all the work, the old skinflint! And&mdash;What else
      have I got to do to-day?... Like to take a good long vacation. Motor trip.
      Something.&rdquo; He sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with Paul
      Riesling.

    <p>
      BABBITT'S preparations for leaving the office to its feeble self during
      the hour and a half of his lunch-period were somewhat less elaborate than
      the plans for a general European war.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fretted to Miss McGoun, &ldquo;What time you going to lunch? Well, make sure
      Miss Bannigan is in then. Explain to her that if Wiedenfeldt calls up,
      she's to tell him I'm already having the title traced. And oh, b' the way,
      remind me to-morrow to have Penniman trace it. Now if anybody comes in
      looking for a cheap house, remember we got to shove that Bangor Road place
      off onto somebody. If you need me, I'll be at the Athletic Club. And&mdash;uh&mdash;And&mdash;uh&mdash;I'll

      He dusted the cigar-ashes off his vest. He placed a difficult unanswered
      letter on the pile of unfinished work, that he might not fail to attend to
      it that afternoon. (For three noons, now, he had placed the same letter on
      the unfinished pile.) He scrawled on a sheet of yellow backing-paper the
      memorandum: &ldquo;See abt apt h drs,&rdquo; which gave him an agreeable feeling of
      having already seen about the apartment-house doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He discovered that he was smoking another cigar. He threw it away,
      protesting, &ldquo;Darn it, I thought you'd quit this darn smoking!&rdquo; He
      courageously returned the cigar-box to the correspondence-file, locked it
      up, hid the key in a more difficult place, and raged, &ldquo;Ought to take care
      of myself. And need more exercise&mdash;walk to the club, every single
      noon&mdash;just what I'll do&mdash;every noon&mdash;cut out this motoring all
      the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The resolution made him feel exemplary. Immediately after it he decided
      that this noon it was too late to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took but little more time to start his car and edge it into the traffic
      than it would have taken to walk the three and a half blocks to the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drove he glanced with the fondness of familiarity at the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger suddenly dropped into the business-center of Zenith could not
      have told whether he was in a city of Oregon or Georgia, Ohio or Maine,
      Oklahoma or Manitoba. But to Babbitt every inch was individual and
      stirring. As always he noted that the California Building across the way
      was three stories lower, therefore three stories less beautiful, than his
      own Reeves Building. As always when he passed the Parthenon Shoe Shine
      Parlor, a one-story hut which beside the granite and red-brick
      ponderousness of the old California Building resembled a bath-house under
      a cliff, he commented, &ldquo;Gosh, ought to get my shoes shined this afternoon.
      Keep forgetting it.&rdquo; At the Simplex Office Furniture Shop, the National
      Cash Register Agency, he yearned for a dictaphone, for a typewriter which
      would add and multiply, as a poet yearns for quartos or a physician for
      radium.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Nobby Men's Wear Shop he took his left hand off the steering-wheel
      to touch his scarf, and thought well of himself as one who bought
      expensive ties &ldquo;and could pay cash for 'em, too, by golly;&rdquo; and at the
      United Cigar Store, with its crimson and gold alertness, he reflected,
      &ldquo;Wonder if I need some cigars&mdash;idiot&mdash;plumb forgot&mdash;going
      t' cut down my fool smoking.&rdquo; He looked at his bank, the Miners' and
      Drovers' National, and considered how clever and solid he was to bank with
      so marbled an establishment. His high moment came in the clash of traffic
      when he was halted at the corner beneath the lofty Second National Tower.
      His car was banked with four others in a line of steel restless as
      cavalry, while the cross town traffic, limousines and enormous moving-vans
      and insistent motor-cycles, poured by; on the farther corner, pneumatic
      riveters rang on the sun-plated skeleton of a new building; and out of
      this tornado flashed the inspiration of a familiar face, and a fellow
      Booster shouted, &ldquo;H' are you, George!&rdquo; Babbitt waved in neighborly
      affection, and slid on with the traffic as the policeman lifted his hand.
      He noted how quickly his car picked up. He felt superior and powerful,
      like a shuttle of polished steel darting in a vast machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always he ignored the next two blocks, decayed blocks not yet reclaimed
      from the grime and shabbiness of the Zenith of 1885. While he was passing
      the five-and-ten-cent store, the Dakota Lodging House, Concordia Hall with
      its lodge-rooms and the offices of fortune-tellers and chiropractors, he
      thought of how much money he made, and he boasted a little and worried a
      little and did old familiar sums:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred fifty plunks this morning from the Lyte deal. But taxes due.
      Let's see: I ought to pull out eight thousand net this year, and save
      fifteen hundred of that&mdash;no, not if I put up garage and&mdash;Let's
      see: six hundred and forty clear last month, and twelve times six-forty
      makes&mdash;makes&mdash;let see: six times twelve is seventy-two hundred
      and&mdash;Oh rats, anyway, I'll make eight thousand&mdash;gee now, that's
      not so bad; mighty few fellows pulling down eight thousand dollars a year&mdash;eight
      thousand good hard iron dollars&mdash;bet there isn't more than five per
      cent. of the people in the whole United States that make more than Uncle
      George does, by golly! Right up at the top of the heap! But&mdash;Way
      expenses are&mdash;Family wasting gasoline, and always dressed like
      millionaires, and sending that eighty a month to Mother&mdash;And all
      these stenographers and salesmen gouging me for every cent they can get&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of his scientific budget-planning was that he felt at once
      triumphantly wealthy and perilously poor, and in the midst of these
      dissertations he stopped his car, rushed into a small news-and-miscellany
      shop, and bought the electric cigar-lighter which he had coveted for a
      week. He dodged his conscience by being jerky and noisy, and by shouting
      at the clerk, &ldquo;Guess this will prett' near pay for itself in matches, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty thing, a nickeled cylinder with an almost silvery socket,
      to be attached to the dashboard of his car. It was not only, as the
      placard on the counter observed, &ldquo;a dandy little refinement, lending the
      last touch of class to a gentleman's auto,&rdquo; but a priceless time-saver. By
      freeing him from halting the car to light a match, it would in a month or
      two easily save ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drove on he glanced at it. &ldquo;Pretty nice. Always wanted one,&rdquo; he said
      wistfully. &ldquo;The one thing a smoker needs, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he remembered that he had given up smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darn it!&rdquo; he mourned. &ldquo;Oh well, I suppose I'll hit a cigar once in a
      while. And&mdash;Be a great convenience for other folks. Might make just
      the difference in getting chummy with some fellow that would put over a
      sale. And&mdash;Certainly looks nice there. Certainly is a mighty clever
      little jigger. Gives the last touch of refinement and class. I&mdash;By
      golly, I guess I can afford it if I want to! Not going to be the only
      member of this family that never has a single doggone luxury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, laden with treasure, after three and a half blocks of romantic
      adventure, he drove up to the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zenith Athletic Club is not athletic and it isn't exactly a club, but
      it is Zenith in perfection. It has an active and smoke-misted billiard
      room, it is represented by baseball and football teams, and in the pool
      and the gymnasium a tenth of the members sporadically try to reduce. But
      most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to lunch,
      play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain out-of town uncles
      at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and its chief hatred is the
      conservative Union Club, which all sound members of the Athletic call &ldquo;a
      rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole&mdash;not one Good Mixer in the
      place&mdash;you couldn't hire me to join.&rdquo; Statistics show that no member
      of the Athletic has ever refused election to the Union, and of those who
      are elected, sixty-seven per cent. resign from the Athletic and are
      thereafter heard to say, in the drowsy sanctity of the Union lounge, &ldquo;The
      Athletic would be a pretty good hotel, if it were more exclusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Athletic Club building is nine stories high, yellow brick with glassy
      roof-garden above and portico of huge limestone columns below. The lobby,
      with its thick pillars of porous Caen stone, its pointed vaulting, and a
      brown glazed-tile floor like well-baked bread-crust, is a combination of
      cathedral-crypt and rathskellar. The members rush into the lobby as though
      they were shopping and hadn't much time for it. Thus did Babbitt enter,
      and to the group standing by the cigar-counter he whooped, &ldquo;How's the
      boys? How's the boys? Well, well, fine day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jovially they whooped back&mdash;Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, Sidney
      Finkelstein, the ladies'-ready-to-wear buyer for Parcher &amp; Stein's
      department-store, and Professor Joseph K. Pumphrey, owner of the Riteway
      Business College and instructor in Public Speaking, Business English,
      Scenario Writing, and Commercial Law. Though Babbitt admired this savant,
      and appreciated Sidney Finkelstein as &ldquo;a mighty smart buyer and a good
      liberal spender,&rdquo; it was to Vergil Gunch that he turned with enthusiasm.
      Mr. Gunch was president of the Boosters' Club, a weekly lunch-club, local
      chapter of a national organization which promoted sound business and
      friendliness among Regular Fellows. He was also no less an official than
      Esteemed Leading Knight in the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks,
      and it was rumored that at the next election he would be a candidate for
      Exalted Ruler. He was a jolly man, given to oratory and to chumminess with
      the arts. He called on the famous actors and vaudeville artists when they
      came to town, gave them cigars, addressed them by their first names, and&mdash;sometimes&mdash;succeeded
      in bringing them to the Boosters' lunches to give The Boys a Free
      Entertainment. He was a large man with hair en brosse, and he knew the
      latest jokes, but he played poker close to the chest. It was at his party
      that Babbitt had sucked in the virus of to-day's restlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunch shouted, &ldquo;How's the old Bolsheviki? How do you feel, the morning
      after the night before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, boy! Some head! That was a regular party you threw, Verg! Hope you
      haven't forgotten I took that last cute little jack-pot!&rdquo; Babbitt
      bellowed. (He was three feet from Gunch.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right now! What I'll hand you next time, Georgie! Say, juh
      notice in the paper the way the New York Assembly stood up to the Reds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I did. That was fine, eh? Nice day to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's one mighty fine spring day, but nights still cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh, you're right they are! Had to have coupla blankets last night, out
      on the sleeping-porch. Say, Sid,&rdquo; Babbitt turned to Finkelstein, the
      buyer, &ldquo;got something wanta ask you about. I went out and bought me an
      electric cigar-lighter for the car, this noon, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good hunch!&rdquo; said Finkelstein, while even the learned Professor Pumphrey,
      a bulbous man with a pepper-and-salt cutaway and a pipe-organ voice,
      commented, &ldquo;That makes a dandy accessory. Cigar-lighter gives tone to the
      dashboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep, finally decided I'd buy me one. Got the best on the market, the
      clerk said it was. Paid five bucks for it. Just wondering if I got stuck.
      What do they charge for 'em at the store, Sid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finkelstein asserted that five dollars was not too great a sum, not for a
      really high-class lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided with
      connections of the very best quality. &ldquo;I always say&mdash;and believe me,
      I base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experience&mdash;the
      best is the cheapest in the long run. Of course if a fellow wants to be a
      Jew about it, he can get cheap junk, but in the long RUN, the cheapest
      thing is&mdash;the best you can get! Now you take here just th' other day:
      I got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I paid out a
      hundred and twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows would say
      that was too much&mdash;Lord, if the Old Folks&mdash;they live in one of
      these hick towns up-state and they simply can't get onto the way a city
      fellow's mind works, and then, of course, they're Jews, and they'd lie
      right down and die if they knew Sid had anted up a hundred and twenty-six
      bones. But I don't figure I was stuck, George, not a bit. Machine looks
      brand new now&mdash;not that it's so darned old, of course; had it less 'n
      three years, but I give it hard service; never drive less 'n a hundred
      miles on Sunday and, uh&mdash;Oh, I don't really think you got stuck,
      George. In the LONG run, the best is, you might say, it's unquestionably
      the cheapest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; said Vergil Gunch. &ldquo;That's the way I look at it. If a
      fellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living, the way you
      get it here in Zenith&mdash;all the hustle and mental activity that's
      going on with a bunch of live-wires like the Boosters and here in the
      Z.A.C., why, he's got to save his nerves by having the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm; and by
      the conclusion, in Gunch's renowned humorous vein, he was enchanted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, at that, George, don't know's you can afford it. I've heard your
      business has been kind of under the eye of the gov'ment since you stole
      the tail of Eathorne Park and sold it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're a great little josher, Verg. But when it comes to kidding, how
      about this report that you stole the black marble steps off the
      post-office and sold 'em for high-grade coal!&rdquo; In delight Babbitt patted
      Gunch's back, stroked his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, but what I want to know is: who's the real-estate shark
      that bought that coal for his apartment-houses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that'll hold you for a while, George!&rdquo; said Finkelstein. &ldquo;I'll
      tell you, though, boys, what I did hear: George's missus went into the
      gents' wear department at Parcher's to buy him some collars, and before
      she could give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. 'How juh
      know the size?' says Mrs. Babbitt, and the clerk says, 'Men that let their
      wives buy collars for 'em always wear thirteen, madam.' How's that! That's
      pretty good, eh? How's that, eh? I guess that'll about fix you, George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer. He
      stopped, stared at the door. Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried,
      &ldquo;See you later, boys,&rdquo; and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then,
      neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the
      breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference,
      nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic
      Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him,
      admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women.
      Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had
      been parted three years, not three days&mdash;and they said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the old horse-thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, &ldquo;You're a fine
      guy, you are! Ten minutes late!&rdquo; Riesling snapped, &ldquo;Well, you're lucky to
      have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!&rdquo; They grinned and went into the
      Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a
      prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own
      images in the massy mirror. Voices thick, satisfied, authoritative,
      hurtled along the marble walls, bounded from the ceiling of
      lavender-bordered milky tiles, while the lords of the city, the barons of
      insurance and law and fertilizers and motor tires, laid down the law for
      Zenith; announced that the day was warm-indeed, indisputably of spring;
      that wages were too high and the interest on mortgages too low; that Babe
      Ruth, the eminent player of baseball, was a noble man; and that &ldquo;those two
      nuts at the Climax Vaudeville Theater this week certainly are a slick pair
      of actors.&rdquo; Babbitt, though ordinarily his voice was the surest and most
      episcopal of all, was silent. In the presence of the slight dark reticence
      of Paul Riesling, he was awkward, he desired to be quiet and firm and
      deft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance lobby of the Athletic Club was Gothic, the washroom Roman
      Imperial, the lounge Spanish Mission, and the reading-room in Chinese
      Chippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the masterpiece
      of Ferdinand Reitman, Zenith's busiest architect. It was lofty and
      half-timbered, with Tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a somewhat
      musicianless musicians'-gallery, and tapestries believed to illustrate the
      granting of Magna Charta. The open beams had been hand-adzed at Jake
      Offutt's car-body works, the hinge; were of hand-wrought iron, the
      wainscot studded with handmade wooden pegs, and at one end of the room was
      a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which the club's
      advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any of the
      fireplaces in European castles but of a draught incomparably more
      scientific. It was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.
      Babbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including
      Gunch, Finkelstein, Professor Pumphrey, Howard Littlefield, his neighbor,
      T. Cholmondeley Frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and Orville Jones,
      whose laundry was in many ways the best in Zenith. They composed a club
      within the club, and merrily called themselves &ldquo;The Roughnecks.&rdquo; To-day as
      he passed their table the Roughnecks greeted him, &ldquo;Come on, sit in! You
      'n' Paul too proud to feed with poor folks? Afraid somebody might stick
      you for a bottle of Bevo, George? Strikes me you swells are getting awful
      darn exclusive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thundered, &ldquo;You bet! We can't afford to have our reps ruined by being
      seen with you tightwads!&rdquo; and guided Paul to one of the small tables
      beneath the musicians'-gallery. He felt guilty. At the Zenith Athletic
      Club, privacy was very bad form. But he wanted Paul to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning he had advocated lighter lunches and now he ordered nothing
      but English mutton chop, radishes, peas, deep-dish apple pie, a bit of
      cheese, and a pot of coffee with cream, adding, as he did invariably, &ldquo;And
      uh&mdash;Oh, and you might give me an order of French fried potatoes.&rdquo;
       When the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it. He always
      peppered and salted his meat, and vigorously, before tasting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul and he took up the spring-like quality of the spring, the virtues of
      the electric cigar-lighter, and the action of the New York State Assembly.
      It was not till Babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton grease that
      he flung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wound up a nice little deal with Conrad Lyte this morning that put five
      hundred good round plunks in my pocket. Pretty nice&mdash;pretty nice! And
      yet&mdash;I don't know what's the matter with me to-day. Maybe it's an
      attack of spring fever, or staying up too late at Verg Gunch's, or maybe
      it's just the winter's work piling up, but I've felt kind of down in the
      mouth all day long. Course I wouldn't beef about it to the fellows at the
      Roughnecks' Table there, but you&mdash;Ever feel that way, Paul? Kind of
      comes over me: here I've pretty much done all the things I ought to;
      supported my family, and got a good house and a six-cylinder car, and
      built up a nice little business, and I haven't any vices 'specially,
      except smoking&mdash;and I'm practically cutting that out, by the way. And
      I belong to the church, and play enough golf to keep in trim, and I only
      associate with good decent fellows. And yet, even so, I don't know that
      I'm entirely satisfied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was drawled out, broken by shouts from the neighboring tables, by
      mechanical love-making to the waitress, by stertorous grunts as the coffee
      filled him with dizziness and indigestion. He was apologetic and doubtful,
      and it was Paul, with his thin voice, who pierced the fog:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, George, you don't suppose it's any novelty to me to find that
      we hustlers, that think we're so all-fired successful, aren't getting much
      out of it? You look as if you expected me to report you as seditious! You
      know what my own life's been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have been a fiddler, and I'm a pedler of tar-roofing! And
      Zilla&mdash;Oh, I don't want to squeal, but you know as well as I do about
      how inspiring a wife she is.... Typical instance last evening: We went to
      the movies. There was a big crowd waiting in the lobby, us at the
      tail-end. She began to push right through it with her 'Sir, how dare you?'
      manner&mdash;Honestly, sometimes when I look at her and see how she's
      always so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and kind
      of always yelping, 'I tell yuh I'm a lady, damn yuh!'&mdash;why, I want to
      kill her! Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her,
      feeling good and ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and
      ready to be the next let in. But there was a little squirt of a man there&mdash;probably
      been waiting half an hour&mdash;I kind of admired the little cuss&mdash;and
      he turns on Zilla and says, perfectly polite, 'Madam, why are you trying
      to push past me?' And she simply&mdash;God, I was so ashamed!&mdash;she
      rips out at him, 'You're no gentleman,' and she drags me into it and
      hollers, 'Paul, this person insulted me!' and the poor skate he got ready
      to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made out I hadn't heard them&mdash;sure! same as you wouldn't hear a
      boiler-factory!&mdash;and I tried to look away&mdash;I can tell you
      exactly how every tile looks in the ceiling of that lobby; there's one
      with brown spots on it like the face of the devil&mdash;and all the time
      the people there&mdash;they were packed in like sardines&mdash;they kept
      making remarks about us, and Zilla went right on talking about the little
      chap, and screeching that 'folks like him oughtn't to be admitted in a
      place that's SUPPOSED to be for ladies and gentlemen,' and 'Paul, will you
      kindly call the manager, so I can report this dirty rat?' and&mdash;Oof!
      Maybe I wasn't glad when I could sneak inside and hide in the dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After twenty-four years of that kind of thing, you don't expect me to
      fall down and foam at the mouth when you hint that this sweet, clean,
      respectable, moral life isn't all it's cracked up to be, do you? I can't
      even talk about it, except to you, because anybody else would think I was
      yellow. Maybe I am. Don't care any longer.... Gosh, you've had to stand a
      lot of whining from me, first and last, Georgie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats, now, Paul, you've never really what you could call whined.
      Sometimes&mdash;I'm always blowing to Myra and the kids about what a whale
      of a realtor I am, and yet sometimes I get a sneaking idea I'm not such a
      Pierpont Morgan as I let on to be. But if I ever do help by jollying you
      along, old Paulski, I guess maybe Saint Pete may let me in after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, you're an old blow-hard, Georgie, you cheerful cut-throat, but
      you've certainly kept me going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you divorce Zilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't I! If I only could! If she'd just give me the chance! You
      couldn't hire her to divorce me, no, nor desert me. She's too fond of her
      three squares and a few pounds of nut-center chocolates in between. If
      she'd only be what they call unfaithful to me! George, I don't want to be
      too much of a stinker; back in college I'd 've thought a man who could say
      that ought to be shot at sunrise. But honestly, I'd be tickled to death if
      she'd really go making love with somebody. Fat chance! Of course she'll
      flirt with anything&mdash;you know how she holds hands and laughs&mdash;that
      laugh&mdash;that horrible brassy laugh&mdash;the way she yaps, 'You
      naughty man, you better be careful or my big husband will be after you!'&mdash;and
      the guy looking me over and thinking, 'Why, you cute little thing, you run
      away now or I'll spank you!' And she'll let him go just far enough so she
      gets some excitement out of it and then she'll begin to do the injured
      innocent and have a beautiful time wailing, 'I didn't think you were that
      kind of a person.' They talk about these demi-vierges in stories&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These WHATS?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;but the wise, hard, corseted, old married women like Zilla are
      worse than any bobbed-haired girl that ever went boldly out into this-here
      storm of life&mdash;and kept her umbrella slid up her sleeve! But rats,
      you know what Zilla is. How she nags&mdash;nags&mdash;nags. How she wants
      everything I can buy her, and a lot that I can't, and how absolutely
      unreasonable she is, and when I get sore and try to have it out with her
      she plays the Perfect Lady so well that even I get fooled and get all
      tangled up in a lot of 'Why did you say's' and 'I didn't mean's.' I'll
      tell you, Georgie: You know my tastes are pretty fairly simple&mdash;in
      the matter of food, at least. Course, as you're always complaining, I do
      like decent cigars&mdash;not those Flor de Cabagos you're smoking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right now! That's a good two-for. By the way, Paul, did I tell
      you I decided to practically cut out smok&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you&mdash;At the same time, if I can't get what I like, why, I can do
      without it. I don't mind sitting down to burnt steak, with canned peaches
      and store cake for a thrilling little dessert afterwards, but I do draw
      the line at having to sympathize with Zilla because she's so rotten
      bad-tempered that the cook has quit, and she's been so busy sitting in a
      dirty lace negligee all afternoon, reading about some brave manly Western
      hero, that she hasn't had time to do any cooking. You're always talking
      about 'morals'&mdash;meaning monogamy, I suppose. You've been the rock of
      ages to me, all right, but you're essentially a simp. You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where d' you get that 'simp,' little man? Let me tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;love to look earnest and inform the world that it's the 'duty of
      responsible business men to be strictly moral, as an example to the
      community.' In fact you're so earnest about morality, old Georgie, that I
      hate to think how essentially immoral you must be underneath. All right,
      you can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, wait now! What's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;talk about morals all you want to, old thing, but believe me, if
      it hadn't been for you and an occasional evening playing the violin to
      Terrill O'Farrell's 'cello, and three or four darling girls that let me
      forget this beastly joke they call 'respectable life,' I'd 've killed
      myself years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And business! The roofing business! Roofs for cowsheds! Oh, I don't mean
      I haven't had a lot of fun out of the Game; out of putting it over on the
      labor unions, and seeing a big check coming in, and the business
      increasing. But what's the use of it? You know, my business isn't
      distributing roofing&mdash;it's principally keeping my competitors from
      distributing roofing. Same with you. All we do is cut each other's throats
      and make the public pay for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here now, Paul! You're pretty darn near talking socialism!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, of course I don't really exactly mean that&mdash;I s'pose. Course&mdash;competition&mdash;brings
      out the best&mdash;survival of the fittest&mdash;but&mdash;But I mean:
      Take all these fellows we know, the kind right here in the club now, that
      seem to be perfectly content with their home-life and their businesses,
      and that boost Zenith and the Chamber of Commerce and holler for a million
      population. I bet if you could cut into their heads you'd find that
      one-third of 'em are sure-enough satisfied with their wives and kids and
      friends and their offices; and one-third feel kind of restless but won't
      admit it; and one-third are miserable and know it. They hate the whole
      peppy, boosting, go-ahead game, and they're bored by their wives and think
      their families are fools&mdash;at least when they come to forty or
      forty-five they're bored&mdash;and they hate business, and they'd go&mdash;Why
      do you suppose there's so many 'mysterious' suicides? Why do you suppose
      so many Substantial Citizens jumped right into the war? Think it was all
      patriotism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt snorted, &ldquo;What do you expect? Think we were sent into the world to
      have a soft time and&mdash;what is it?&mdash;'float on flowery beds of
      ease'? Think Man was just made to be happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Though I've never discovered anybody that knew what the deuce
      Man really was made for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well we know&mdash;not just in the Bible alone, but it stands to reason&mdash;a
      man who doesn't buckle down and do his duty, even if it does bore him
      sometimes, is nothing but a&mdash;well, he's simply a weakling.
      Mollycoddle, in fact! And what do you advocate? Come down to cases! If a
      man is bored by his wife, do you seriously mean he has a right to chuck
      her and take a sneak, or even kill himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, I don't know what 'rights' a man has! And I don't know the
      solution of boredom. If I did, I'd be the one philosopher that had the
      cure for living. But I do know that about ten times as many people find
      their lives dull, and unnecessarily dull, as ever admit it; and I do
      believe that if we busted out and admitted it sometimes, instead of being
      nice and patient and loyal for sixty years, and then nice and patient and
      dead for the rest of eternity, why, maybe, possibly, we might make life
      more fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drifted into a maze of speculation. Babbitt was elephantishly uneasy.
      Paul was bold, but not quite sure about what he was being bold. Now and
      then Babbitt suddenly agreed with Paul in an admission which contradicted
      all his defense of duty and Christian patience, and at each admission he
      had a curious reckless joy. He said at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old Paul, you do a lot of talking about kicking things in the
      face, but you never kick. Why don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody does. Habit too strong. But&mdash;Georgie, I've been thinking of
      one mild bat&mdash;oh, don't worry, old pillar of monogamy; it's highly
      proper. It seems to be settled now, isn't it&mdash;though of course Zilla
      keeps rooting for a nice expensive vacation in New York and Atlantic City,
      with the bright lights and the bootlegged cocktails and a bunch of
      lounge-lizards to dance with&mdash;but the Babbitts and the Rieslings are
      sure-enough going to Lake Sunasquam, aren't we? Why couldn't you and I
      make some excuse&mdash;say business in New York&mdash;and get up to Maine
      four or five days before they do, and just loaf by ourselves and smoke and
      cuss and be natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great! Great idea!&rdquo; Babbitt admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for fourteen years had he taken a holiday without his wife, and
      neither of them quite believed they could commit this audacity. Many
      members of the Athletic Club did go camping without their wives, but they
      were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the sacred and
      unchangeable sports of Babbitt and Paul Riesling were golfing, motoring,
      and bridge. For either the fishermen or the golfers to have changed their
      habits would have been an infraction of their self-imposed discipline
      which would have shocked all right-thinking and regularized citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt blustered, &ldquo;Why don't we just put our foot down and say, 'We're
      going on ahead of you, and that's all there is to it!' Nothing criminal in
      it. Simply say to Zilla&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say anything to Zilla simply. Why, Georgie, she's almost as
      much of a moralist as you are, and if I told her the truth she'd believe
      we were going to meet some dames in New York. And even Myra&mdash;she
      never nags you, the way Zilla does, but she'd worry. She'd say, 'Don't you
      WANT me to go to Maine with you? I shouldn't dream of going unless you
      wanted me;' and you'd give in to save her feelings. Oh, the devil! Let's
      have a shot at duck-pins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the game of duck-pins, a juvenile form of bowling, Paul was silent.
      As they came down the steps of the club, not more than half an hour after
      the time at which Babbitt had sternly told Miss McGoun he would be back,
      Paul sighed, &ldquo;Look here, old man, oughtn't to talked about Zilla way I
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats, old man, it lets off steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know! After spending all noon sneering at the conventional stuff,
      I'm conventional enough to be ashamed of saving my life by busting out
      with my fool troubles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Paul, your nerves are kind of on the bum. I'm going to take you away.
      I'm going to rig this thing. I'm going to have an important deal in New
      York and&mdash;and sure, of course!&mdash;I'll need you to advise me on
      the roof of the building! And the ole deal will fall through, and there'll
      be nothing for us but to go on ahead to Maine. I&mdash;Paul, when it comes
      right down to it, I don't care whether you bust loose or not. I do like
      having a rep for being one of the Bunch, but if you ever needed me I'd
      chuck it and come out for you every time! Not of course but what you're&mdash;course
      I don't mean you'd ever do anything that would put&mdash;that would put a
      decent position on the fritz but&mdash;See how I mean? I'm kind of a
      clumsy old codger, and I need your fine Eyetalian hand. We&mdash;Oh, hell,
      I can't stand here gassing all day! On the job! S' long! Don't take any
      wooden money, Paulibus! See you soon! S' long!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HE forgot Paul Riesling in an afternoon of not unagreeable details. After
      a return to his office, which seemed to have staggered on without him, he
      drove a &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; out to view a four-flat tenement in the Linton
      district. He was inspired by the customer's admiration of the new
      cigar-lighter. Thrice its novelty made him use it, and thrice he hurled
      half-smoked cigarettes from the car, protesting, &ldquo;I GOT to quit smoking so
      blame much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their ample discussion of every detail of the cigar-lighter led them to
      speak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for being
      so shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a hot-water bottle, and he
      announced that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had
      enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all
      mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding
      each new intricate mechanism&mdash;metal lathe, two-jet carburetor,
      machine gun, oxyacetylene welder&mdash;he learned one good
      realistic-sounding phrase, and used it over and over, with a delightful
      feeling of being technical and initiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customer joined him in the worship of machinery, and they came
      buoyantly up to the tenement and began that examination of plastic slate
      roof, kalamein doors, and seven-eighths-inch blind-nailed flooring, began
      those diplomacies of hurt surprise and readiness to be persuaded to do
      something they had already decided to do, which would some day result in a
      sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way back Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry T.
      Thompson, at his kitchen-cabinet works, and they drove through South
      Zenith, a high-colored, banging, exciting region: new factories of hollow
      tile with gigantic wire-glass windows, surly old red-brick factories
      stained with tar, high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks like
      locomotives, and, on a score of hectic side-tracks, far-wandering
      freight-cars from the New York Central and apple orchards, the Great
      Northern and wheat-plateaus, the Southern Pacific and orange groves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked to the secretary of the Zenith Foundry Company about an
      interesting artistic project&mdash;a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane
      Cemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the
      sales-manager, Noel Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for Thompson.
      Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters' Club, and no
      Booster felt right if he bought anything from another Booster without
      receiving a discount. But Henry Thompson growled, &ldquo;Oh, t' hell with 'em!
      I'm not going to crawl around mooching discounts, not from nobody.&rdquo; It was
      one of the differences between Thompson, the old-fashioned, lean Yankee,
      rugged, traditional, stage type of American business man, and Babbitt, the
      plump, smooth, efficient, up-to-the-minute and otherwise perfected modern.
      Whenever Thompson twanged, &ldquo;Put your John Hancock on that line,&rdquo; Babbitt
      was as much amused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper
      Englishman by any American. He knew himself to be of a breeding altogether
      more esthetic and sensitive than Thompson's. He was a college graduate, he
      played golf, he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he
      went to Chicago he took a room with a private bath. &ldquo;The whole thing is,&rdquo;
       he explained to Paul Riesling, &ldquo;these old codgers lack the subtlety that
      you got to have to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This advance in civilization could be carried too far, Babbitt perceived.
      Noel Ryland, sales-manager of the Zeeco, was a frivolous graduate of
      Princeton, while Babbitt was a sound and standard ware from that great
      department-store, the State University. Ryland wore spats, he wrote long
      letters about City Planning and Community Singing, and, though he was a
      Booster, he was known to carry in his pocket small volumes of poetry in a
      foreign language. All this was going too far. Henry Thompson was the
      extreme of insularity, and Noel Ryland the extreme of frothiness, while
      between them, supporting the state, defending the evangelical churches and
      domestic brightness and sound business, were Babbitt and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this just estimate of himself&mdash;and with the promise of a
      discount on Thompson's car&mdash;he returned to his office in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he went through the corridor of the Reeves Building he sighed,
      &ldquo;Poor old Paul! I got to&mdash;Oh, damn Noel Ryland! Damn Charley
      McKelvey! Just because they make more money than I do, they think they're
      so superior. I wouldn't be found dead in their stuffy old Union Club! I&mdash;Somehow,
      to-day, I don't feel like going back to work. Oh well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered telephone calls, he read the four o'clock mail, he signed his
      morning's letters, he talked to a tenant about repairs, he fought with
      Stanley Graff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Graff, the outside salesman, was always hinting that he deserved an
      increase of commission, and to-day he complained, &ldquo;I think I ought to get
      a bonus if I put through the Heiler sale. I'm chasing around and working
      on it every single evening, almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt frequently remarked to his wife that it was better to &ldquo;con your
      office-help along and keep 'em happy 'stead of jumping on 'em and poking
      'em up&mdash;get more work out of 'em that way,&rdquo; but this unexampled lack
      of appreciation hurt him, and he turned on Graff:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Stan; let's get this clear. You've got an idea somehow that
      it's you that do all the selling. Where d' you get that stuff? Where d'
      you think you'd be if it wasn't for our capital behind you, and our lists
      of properties, and all the prospects we find for you? All you got to do is
      follow up our tips and close the deal. The hall-porter could sell
      Babbitt-Thompson listings! You say you're engaged to a girl, but have to
      put in your evenings chasing after buyers. Well, why the devil shouldn't
      you? What do you want to do? Sit around holding her hand? Let me tell you,
      Stan, if your girl is worth her salt, she'll be glad to know you're out
      hustling, making some money to furnish the home-nest, instead of doing the
      lovey-dovey. The kind of fellow that kicks about working overtime, that
      wants to spend his evenings reading trashy novels or spooning and
      exchanging a lot of nonsense and foolishness with some girl, he ain't the
      kind of upstanding, energetic young man, with a future&mdash;and with
      Vision!&mdash;that we want here. How about it? What's your Ideal, anyway?
      Do you want to make money and be a responsible member of the community, or
      do you want to be a loafer, with no Inspiration or Pep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Graff was not so amenable to Vision and Ideals as usual. &ldquo;You bet I want
      to make money! That's why I want that bonus! Honest, Mr. Babbitt, I don't
      want to get fresh, but this Heiler house is a terror. Nobody'll fall for
      it. The flooring is rotten and the walls are full of cracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly what I mean! To a salesman with a love for his profession,
      it's hard problems like that that inspire him to do his best. Besides,
      Stan&mdash;Matter o' fact, Thompson and I are against bonuses, as a matter
      of principle. We like you, and we want to help you so you can get married,
      but we can't be unfair to the others on the staff. If we start giving you
      bonuses, don't you see we're going to hurt the feeling and be unjust to
      Penniman and Laylock? Right's right, and discrimination is unfair, and
      there ain't going to be any of it in this office! Don't get the idea,
      Stan, that because during the war salesmen were hard to hire, now, when
      there's a lot of men out of work, there aren't a slew of bright young
      fellows that would be glad to step in and enjoy your opportunities, and
      not act as if Thompson and I were his enemies and not do any work except
      for bonuses. How about it, heh? How about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;gee&mdash;of course&mdash;&rdquo; sighed Graff, as he went
      out, crabwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt did not often squabble with his employees. He liked to like the
      people about him; he was dismayed when they did not like him. It was only
      when they attacked the sacred purse that he was frightened into fury, but
      then, being a man given to oratory and high principles, he enjoyed the
      sound of his own vocabulary and the warmth of his own virtue. Today he had
      so passionately indulged in self-approval that he wondered whether he had
      been entirely just:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, Stan isn't a boy any more. Oughtn't to call him so hard. But
      rats, got to haul folks over the coals now and then for their own good.
      Unpleasant duty, but&mdash;I wonder if Stan is sore? What's he saying to
      McGoun out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal
      comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. He was distressed by losing
      that approval of his employees to which an executive is always slave.
      Ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy directions
      to the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks to-morrow,
      and Miss McGoun and Miss Bannigan would do well to be there early, and for
      heaven's sake remind him to call up Conrad Lyte soon 's he came in.
      To-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness. He was as
      afraid of his still-faced clerks&mdash;of the eyes focused on him, Miss
      McGoun staring with head lifted from her typing, Miss Bannigan looking
      over her ledger, Mat Penniman craning around at his desk in the dark
      alcove, Stanley Graff sullenly expressionless&mdash;as a parvenu before
      the bleak propriety of his butler. He hated to expose his back to their
      laughter, and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered and was
      raucously friendly and oozed wretchedly out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he forgot his misery when he saw from Smith Street the charms of
      Floral Heights; the roofs of red tile and green slate, the shining new
      sun-parlors, and the stainless walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to inform Howard Littlefield, his scholarly neighbor, that
      though the day had been springlike the evening might be cold. He went in
      to shout &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; at his wife, with no very definite desire to
      know where she was. He examined the lawn to see whether the furnace-man
      had raked it properly. With some satisfaction and a good deal of
      discussion of the matter with Mrs. Babbitt, Ted, and Howard Littlefield,
      he concluded that the furnace-man had not raked it properly. He cut two
      tufts of wild grass with his wife's largest dressmaking-scissors; he
      informed Ted that it was all nonsense having a furnace-man&mdash;&ldquo;big
      husky fellow like you ought to do all the work around the house;&rdquo; and
      privately he meditated that it was agreeable to have it known throughout
      the neighborhood that he was so prosperous that his son never worked
      around the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on the sleeping-porch and did his day's exercises: arms out
      sidewise for two minutes, up for two minutes, while he muttered, &ldquo;Ought
      take more exercise; keep in shape;&rdquo; then went in to see whether his collar
      needed changing before dinner. As usual it apparently did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lettish-Croat maid, a powerful woman, beat the dinner-gong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roast of beef, roasted potatoes, and string beans were excellent this
      evening and, after an adequate sketch of the day's progressive
      weather-states, his four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fee, his lunch with Paul
      Riesling, and the proven merits of the new cigar-lighter, he was moved to
      a benign, &ldquo;Sort o' thinking about buyin, a new car. Don't believe we'll
      get one till next year, but still we might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verona, the older daughter, cried, &ldquo;Oh, Dad, if you do, why don't you get
      a sedan? That would be perfectly slick! A closed car is so much more comfy
      than an open one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I don't know about that. I kind of like an open car. You get
      more fresh air that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shoot, that's just because you never tried a sedan. Let's get one.
      It's got a lot more class,&rdquo; said Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A closed car does keep the clothes nicer,&rdquo; from Mrs. Babbitt; &ldquo;You don't
      get your hair blown all to pieces,&rdquo; from Verona; &ldquo;It's a lot sportier,&rdquo;
       from Ted; and from Tinka, the youngest, &ldquo;Oh, let's have a sedan! Mary
      Ellen's father has got one.&rdquo; Ted wound up, &ldquo;Oh, everybody's got a closed
      car now, except us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt faced them: &ldquo;I guess you got nothing very terrible to complain
      about! Anyway, I don't keep a car just to enable you children to look like
      millionaires! And I like an open car, so you can put the top down on
      summer evenings and go out for a drive and get some good fresh air.
      Besides&mdash;A closed car costs more money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, gee whiz, if the Doppelbraus can afford a closed car, I guess we
      can!&rdquo; prodded Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I make eight thousand a year to his seven! But I don't blow it all
      in and waste it and throw it around, the way he does! Don't believe in
      this business of going and spending a whole lot of money to show off and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went, with ardor and some thoroughness, into the matters of
      streamline bodies, hill-climbing power, wire wheels, chrome steel,
      ignition systems, and body colors. It was much more than a study of
      transportation. It was an aspiration for knightly rank. In the city of
      Zenith, in the barbarous twentieth century, a family's motor indicated its
      social rank as precisely as the grades of the peerage determined the rank
      of an English family&mdash;indeed, more precisely, considering the opinion
      of old county families upon newly created brewery barons and woolen-mill
      viscounts. The details of precedence were never officially determined.
      There was no court to decide whether the second son of a Pierce Arrow
      limousine should go in to dinner before the first son of a Buick roadster,
      but of their respective social importance there was no doubt; and where
      Babbitt as a boy had aspired to the presidency, his son Ted aspired to a
      Packard twin-six and an established position in the motored gentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favor which Babbitt had won from his family by speaking of a new car
      evaporated as they realized that he didn't intend to buy one this year.
      Ted lamented, &ldquo;Oh, punk! The old boat looks as if it'd had fleas and been
      scratching its varnish off.&rdquo; Mrs. Babbitt said abstractedly, &ldquo;Snoway
      talkcher father.&rdquo; Babbitt raged, &ldquo;If you're too much of a high-class
      gentleman, and you belong to the bon ton and so on, why, you needn't take
      the car out this evening.&rdquo; Ted explained, &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;&rdquo; and
      dinner dragged on with normal domestic delight to the inevitable point at
      which Babbitt protested, &ldquo;Come, come now, we can't sit here all evening.
      Give the girl a chance to clear away the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was fretting, &ldquo;What a family! I don't know how we all get to scrapping
      this way. Like to go off some place and be able to hear myself think....
      Paul ... Maine ... Wear old pants, and loaf, and cuss.&rdquo; He said cautiously
      to his wife, &ldquo;I've been in correspondence with a man in New York&mdash;wants
      me to see him about a real-estate trade&mdash;may not come off till
      summer. Hope it doesn't break just when we and the Rieslings get ready to
      go to Maine. Be a shame if we couldn't make the trip there together. Well,
      no use worrying now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verona escaped, immediately after dinner, with no discussion save an
      automatic &ldquo;Why don't you ever stay home?&rdquo; from Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the living-room, in a corner of the davenport, Ted settled down to his
      Home Study; plain geometry, Cicero, and the agonizing metaphors of Comus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why they give us this old-fashioned junk by Milton and
      Shakespeare and Wordsworth and all these has-beens,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Oh, I
      guess I could stand it to see a show by Shakespeare, if they had swell
      scenery and put on a lot of dog, but to sit down in cold blood and READ
      'em&mdash;These teachers&mdash;how do they get that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt, darning socks, speculated, &ldquo;Yes, I wonder why. Of course I
      don't want to fly in the face of the professors and everybody, but I do
      think there's things in Shakespeare&mdash;not that I read him much, but
      when I was young the girls used to show me passages that weren't, really,
      they weren't at all nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt looked up irritably from the comic strips in the Evening Advocate.
      They composed his favorite literature and art, these illustrated
      chronicles in which Mr. Mutt hit Mr. Jeff with a rotten egg, and Mother
      corrected Father's vulgarisms by means of a rolling-pin. With the solemn
      face of a devotee, breathing heavily through his open mouth, he plodded
      nightly through every picture, and during the rite he detested
      interruptions. Furthermore, he felt that on the subject of Shakespeare he
      wasn't really an authority. Neither the Advocate-Times, the Evening
      Advocate, nor the Bulletin of the Zenith Chamber of Commerce had ever had
      an editorial on the matter, and until one of them had spoken he found it
      hard to form an original opinion. But even at risk of floundering in
      strange bogs, he could not keep out of an open controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you why you have to study Shakespeare and those. It's because
      they're required for college entrance, and that's all there is to it!
      Personally, I don't see myself why they stuck 'em into an up-to-date
      high-school system like we have in this state. Be a good deal better if
      you took Business English, and learned how to write an ad, or letters that
      would pull. But there it is, and there's no talk, argument, or discussion
      about it! Trouble with you, Ted, is you always want to do something
      different! If you're going to law-school&mdash;and you are!&mdash;I never
      had a chance to, but I'll see that you do&mdash;why, you'll want to lay in
      all the English and Latin you can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh punk. I don't see what's the use of law-school&mdash;or even finishing
      high school. I don't want to go to college 'specially. Honest, there's lot
      of fellows that have graduated from colleges that don't begin to make as
      much money as fellows that went to work early. Old Shimmy Peters, that
      teaches Latin in the High, he's a what-is-it from Columbia and he sits up
      all night reading a lot of greasy books and he's always spieling about the
      'value of languages,' and the poor soak doesn't make but eighteen hundred
      a year, and no traveling salesman would think of working for that. I know
      what I'd like to do. I'd like to be an aviator, or own a corking big
      garage, or else&mdash;a fellow was telling me about it yesterday&mdash;I'd
      like to be one of these fellows that the Standard Oil Company sends out to
      China, and you live in a compound and don't have to do any work, and you
      get to see the world and pagodas and the ocean and everything! And then I
      could take up correspondence-courses. That's the real stuff! You don't
      have to recite to some frosty-faced old dame that's trying to show off to
      the principal, and you can study any subject you want to. Just listen to
      these! I clipped out the ads of some swell courses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched from the back of his geometry half a hundred advertisements of
      those home-study courses which the energy and foresight of American
      commerce have contributed to the science of education. The first displayed
      the portrait of a young man with a pure brow, an iron jaw, silk socks, and
      hair like patent leather. Standing with one hand in his trousers-pocket
      and the other extended with chiding forefinger, he was bewitching an
      audience of men with gray beards, paunches, bald heads, and every other
      sign of wisdom and prosperity. Above the picture was an inspiring
      educational symbol&mdash;no antiquated lamp or torch or owl of Minerva,
      but a row of dollar signs. The text ran:

      Who do you think I ran into the other evening at the De Luxe Restaurant?
      Why, old Freddy Durkee, that used to be a dead or-alive shipping clerk in
      my old place&mdash;Mr. Mouse-Man we used to laughingly call the dear
      fellow. One time he was so timid he was plumb scared of the Super, and
      never got credit for the dandy work he did. Him at the De Luxe! And if he
      wasn't ordering a tony feed with all the &ldquo;fixings&rdquo; from celery to nuts!
      And instead of being embarrassed by the waiters, like he used to be at the
      little dump where we lunched in Old Lang Syne, he was bossing them around
      like he was a millionaire!
    </p>
    <p>
      I cautiously asked him what he was doing. Freddy laughed and said, &ldquo;Say,
      old chum, I guess you're wondering what's come over me. You'll be glad to
      know I'm now Assistant Super at the old shop, and right on the High Road
      to Prosperity and Domination, and I look forward with confidence to a
      twelve-cylinder car, and the wife is making things hum in the best society
      and the kiddies getting a first-class education.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Babbitt was again without a canon which would enable him to speak with
      authority. Nothing in motoring or real estate had indicated what a Solid
      Citizen and Regular Fellow ought to think about culture by mail. He began
      with hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;sounds as if it covered the ground. It certainly is a fine
      thing to be able to orate. I've sometimes thought I had a little talent
      that way myself, and I know darn well that one reason why a fourflushing
      old back-number like Chan Mott can get away with it in real estate is just
      because he can make a good talk, even when he hasn't got a doggone thing
      to say! And it certainly is pretty cute the way they get out all these
      courses on various topics and subjects nowadays. I'll tell you, though: No
      need to blow in a lot of good money on this stuff when you can get a
      first-rate course in eloquence and English and all that right in your own
      school&mdash;and one of the biggest school buildings in the entire
      country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Babbitt comfortably, while Ted complained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, but Dad, they just teach a lot of old junk that isn't any practical
      use&mdash;except the manual training and typewriting and basketball and
      dancing&mdash;and in these correspondence-courses, gee, you can get all
      kinds of stuff that would come in handy. Say, listen to this one:
    </p>
    <p>
      'CAN YOU PLAY A MAN'S PART?
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you are walking with your mother, sister or best girl and some one
      passes a slighting remark or uses improper language, won't you be ashamed
      if you can't take her part? Well, can you?
    </p>
    <p>
      'We teach boxing and self-defense by mail. Many pupils have written saying
      that after a few lessons they've outboxed bigger and heavier opponents.
      The lessons start with simple movements practised before your mirror&mdash;holding
      out your hand for a coin, the breast-stroke in swimming, etc. Before you
      realize it you are striking scientifically, ducking, guarding and
      feinting, just as if you had a real opponent before you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, baby, maybe I wouldn't like that!&rdquo; Ted chanted. &ldquo;I'll tell the world!
      Gosh, I'd like to take one fellow I know in school that's always shooting
      off his mouth, and catch him alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! The idea! Most useless thing I ever heard of!&rdquo; Babbitt
      fulminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just suppose I was walking with Mama or Rone, and somebody passed a
      slighting remark or used improper language. What would I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you'd probably bust the record for the hundred-yard dash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I WOULD not! I'd stand right up to any mucker that passed a slighting
      remark on MY sister and I'd show him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, young Dempsey! If I ever catch you fighting I'll whale the
      everlasting daylights out of you&mdash;and I'll do it without practising
      holding out my hand for a coin before the mirror, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ted dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Babbitt said placidly, &ldquo;it's not at all nice, your
      talking of fighting this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gosh almighty, that's a fine way to appreciate&mdash;And then
      suppose I was walking with YOU, Ma, and somebody passed a slighting remark&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody's going to pass no slighting remarks on nobody,&rdquo; Babbitt observed,
      &ldquo;not if they stay home and study their geometry and mind their own affairs
      instead of hanging around a lot of poolrooms and soda-fountains and places
      where nobody's got any business to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But gooooooosh, Dad, if they DID!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt chirped, &ldquo;Well, if they did, I wouldn't do them the honor of
      paying any attention to them! Besides, they never do. You always hear
      about these women that get followed and insulted and all, but I don't
      believe a word of it, or it's their own fault, the way some women look at
      a person. I certainly never 've been insulted by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw shoot. Mother, just suppose you WERE sometime! Just SUPPOSE! Can't you
      suppose something? Can't you imagine things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I can imagine things! The idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly your mother can imagine things&mdash;and suppose things! Think
      you're the only member of this household that's got an imagination?&rdquo;
       Babbitt demanded. &ldquo;But what's the use of a lot of supposing? Supposing
      never gets you anywhere. No sense supposing when there's a lot of real
      facts to take into considera&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Dad. Suppose&mdash;I mean, just&mdash;just suppose you were in
      your office and some rival real-estate man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Realtor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;some realtor that you hated came in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't hate any realtor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose you DID!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't intend to suppose anything of the kind! There's plenty of fellows
      in my profession that stoop and hate their competitors, but if you were a
      little older and understood business, instead of always going to the
      movies and running around with a lot of fool girls with their dresses up
      to their knees and powdered and painted and rouged and God knows what all
      as if they were chorus-girls, then you'd know&mdash;and you'd suppose&mdash;that
      if there's any one thing that I stand for in the real-estate circles of
      Zenith, it is that we ought to always speak of each other only in the
      friendliest terms and institute a spirit of brotherhood and cooperation,
      and so I certainly can't suppose and I can't imagine my hating any
      realtor, not even that dirty, fourflushing society sneak, Cecil Rountree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's no If, And or But about it! But if I WERE going to lambaste
      somebody, I wouldn't require any fancy ducks or swimming-strokes before a
      mirror, or any of these doodads and flipflops! Suppose you were out some
      place and a fellow called you vile names. Think you'd want to box and jump
      around like a dancing-master? You'd just lay him out cold (at least I
      certainly hope any son of mine would!) and then you'd dust off your hands
      and go on about your business, and that's all there is to it, and you
      aren't going to have any boxing-lessons by mail, either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well but&mdash;Yes&mdash;I just wanted to show how many different kinds
      of correspondence-courses there are, instead of all the camembert they
      teach us in the High.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought they taught boxing in the school gymnasium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's different. They stick you up there and some big stiff amuses
      himself pounding the stuffin's out of you before you have a chance to
      learn. Hunka! Not any! But anyway&mdash;Listen to some of these others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advertisements were truly philanthropic. One of them bore the rousing
      headline: &ldquo;Money! Money!! Money!!!&rdquo; The second announced that &ldquo;Mr. P. R.,
      formerly making only eighteen a week in a barber shop, writes to us that
      since taking our course he is now pulling down $5,000 as an Osteo-vitalic
      Physician;&rdquo; and the third that &ldquo;Miss J. L., recently a wrapper in a store,
      is now getting Ten Real Dollars a day teaching our Hindu System of
      Vibratory Breathing and Mental Control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted had collected fifty or sixty announcements, from annual
      reference-books, from Sunday School periodicals, fiction-magazines, and
      journals of discussion. One benefactor implored, &ldquo;Don't be a Wallflower&mdash;Be
      More Popular and Make More Money&mdash;YOU Can Ukulele or Sing Yourself
      into Society! By the secret principles of a Newly Discovered System of
      Music Teaching, any one&mdash;man, lady or child&mdash;can, without
      tiresome exercises, special training or long drawn out study, and without
      waste of time, money or energy, learn to play by note, piano, banjo,
      cornet, clarinet, saxophone, violin or drum, and learn sight-singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next, under the wistful appeal &ldquo;Finger Print Detectives Wanted&mdash;Big
      Incomes!&rdquo; confided: &ldquo;YOU red-blooded men and women&mdash;this is the
      PROFESSION you have been looking for. There's MONEY in it, BIG money, and
      that rapid change of scene, that entrancing and compelling interest and
      fascination, which your active mind and adventurous spirit crave. Think of
      being the chief figure and directing factor in solving strange mysteries
      and baffling crimes. This wonderful profession brings you into contact
      with influential men on the basis of equality, and often calls upon you to
      travel everywhere, maybe to distant lands&mdash;all expenses paid. NO
      SPECIAL EDUCATION REQUIRED.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, boy! I guess that wins the fire-brick necklace! Wouldn't it be swell
      to travel everywhere and nab some famous crook!&rdquo; whooped Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't think much of that. Doggone likely to get hurt. Still, that
      music-study stunt might be pretty fair, though. There's no reason why, if
      efficiency-experts put their minds to it the way they have to routing
      products in a factory, they couldn't figure out some scheme so a person
      wouldn't have to monkey with all this practising and exercises that you
      get in music.&rdquo; Babbitt was impressed, and he had a delightful parental
      feeling that they two, the men of the family, understood each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to the notices of mail-box universities which taught
      Short-story Writing and Improving the Memory, Motion-picture-acting and
      Developing the Soul-power, Banking and Spanish, Chiropody and Photography,
      Electrical Engineering and Window-trimming, Poultry-raising and Chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt sought for adequate expression of his
      admiration. &ldquo;I'm a son of a gun! I knew this correspondence-school
      business had become a mighty profitable game&mdash;makes suburban
      real-estate look like two cents!&mdash;but I didn't realize it'd got to be
      such a reg'lar key-industry! Must rank right up with groceries and movies.
      Always figured somebody'd come along with the brains to not leave
      education to a lot of bookworms and impractical theorists but make a big
      thing out of it. Yes, I can see how a lot of these courses might interest
      you. I must ask the fellows at the Athletic if they ever realized&mdash;But
      same time, Ted, you know how advertisers, I means some advertisers,
      exaggerate. I don't know as they'd be able to jam you through these
      courses as fast as they claim they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh sure, Dad; of course.&rdquo; Ted had the immense and joyful maturity of a
      boy who is respectfully listened to by his elders. Babbitt concentrated on
      him with grateful affection:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see what an influence these courses might have on the whole
      educational works. Course I'd never admit it publicly&mdash;fellow like
      myself, a State U. graduate, it's only decent and patriotic for him to
      blow his horn and boost the Alma Mater&mdash;but smatter of fact, there's
      a whole lot of valuable time lost even at the U., studying poetry and
      French and subjects that never brought in anybody a cent. I don't know but
      what maybe these correspondence-courses might prove to be one of the most
      important American inventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble with a lot of folks is: they're so blame material; they don't see
      the spiritual and mental side of American supremacy; they think that
      inventions like the telephone and the areoplane and wireless&mdash;no,
      that was a Wop invention, but anyway: they think these mechanical
      improvements are all that we stand for; whereas to a real thinker, he sees
      that spiritual and, uh, dominating movements like Efficiency, and
      Rotarianism, and Prohibition, and Democracy are what compose our deepest
      and truest wealth. And maybe this new principle in education-at-home may
      be another&mdash;may be another factor. I tell you, Ted, we've got to have
      Vision&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think those correspondence-courses are terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The philosophers gasped. It was Mrs. Babbitt who had made this discord in
      their spiritual harmony, and one of Mrs. Babbitt's virtues was that,
      except during dinner-parties, when she was transformed into a raging
      hostess, she took care of the house and didn't bother the males by
      thinking. She went on firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds awful to me, the way they coax those poor young folks to think
      they're learning something, and nobody 'round to help them and&mdash;You
      two learn so quick, but me, I always was slow. But just the same&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt attended to her: &ldquo;Nonsense! Get just as much, studying at home.
      You don't think a fellow learns any more because he blows in his father's
      hard-earned money and sits around in Morris chairs in a swell Harvard
      dormitory with pictures and shields and table-covers and those doodads, do
      you? I tell you, I'm a college man&mdash;I KNOW! There is one objection
      you might make though. I certainly do protest against any effort to get a
      lot of fellows out of barber shops and factories into the professions.
      They're too crowded already, and what'll we do for workmen if all those
      fellows go and get educated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted was leaning back, smoking a cigarette without reproof. He was, for the
      moment, sharing the high thin air of Babbitt's speculation as though he
      were Paul Riesling or even Dr. Howard Littlefield. He hinted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think then, Dad? Wouldn't it be a good idea if I could
      go off to China or some peppy place, and study engineering or something by
      mail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and I'll tell you why, son. I've found out it's a mighty nice thing
      to be able to say you're a B.A. Some client that doesn't know what you are
      and thinks you're just a plug business man, he gets to shooting off his
      mouth about economics or literature or foreign trade conditions, and you
      just ease in something like, 'When I was in college&mdash;course I got my
      B.A. in sociology and all that junk&mdash;' Oh, it puts an awful crimp in
      their style! But there wouldn't be any class to saying 'I got the degree
      of Stamp-licker from the Bezuzus Mail-order University!' You see&mdash;My
      dad was a pretty good old coot, but he never had much style to him, and I
      had to work darn hard to earn my way through college. Well, it's been
      worth it, to be able to associate with the finest gentlemen in Zenith, at
      the clubs and so on, and I wouldn't want you to drop out of the gentlemen
      class&mdash;the class that are just as red-blooded as the Common People
      but still have power and personality. It would kind of hurt me if you did
      that, old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Dad! Sure! All right. I'll stick to it. Say! Gosh! Gee whiz! I
      forgot all about those kids I was going to take to the chorus rehearsal.
      I'll have to duck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't done all your home-work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it first thing in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six times in the past sixty days Babbitt had stormed, &ldquo;You will not 'do it
      first thing in the morning'! You'll do it right now!&rdquo; but to-night he
      said, &ldquo;Well, better hustle,&rdquo; and his smile was the rare shy radiance he
      kept for Paul Riesling.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ted's a good boy,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's these girls he's going to pick up? Are they nice decent girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Oh dear, Ted never tells me anything any more. I don't
      understand what's come over the children of this generation. I used to
      have to tell Papa and Mama everything, but seems like the children to-day
      have just slipped away from all control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they're decent girls. Course Ted's no longer a kid, and I wouldn't
      want him to, uh, get mixed up and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George: I wonder if you oughtn't to take him aside and tell him about&mdash;Things!&rdquo;
       She blushed and lowered her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know. Way I figure it, Myra, no sense suggesting a lot of
      Things to a boy's mind. Think up enough devilment by himself. But I wonder&mdash;It's
      kind of a hard question. Wonder what Littlefield thinks about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course Papa agrees with you. He says all this&mdash;Instruction is&mdash;He
      says 'tisn't decent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he does, does he! Well, let me tell you that whatever Henry T.
      Thompson thinks&mdash;about morals, I mean, though course you can't beat
      the old duffer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what a way to talk of Papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;simply can't beat him at getting in on the ground floor of a deal,
      but let me tell you whenever he springs any ideas about higher things and
      education, then I know I think just the opposite. You may not regard me as
      any great brain-shark, but believe me, I'm a regular college president,
      compared with Henry T.! Yes sir, by golly, I'm going to take Ted aside and
      tell him why I lead a strictly moral life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, will you? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When? When? What's the use of trying to pin me down to When and Why and
      Where and How and When? That's the trouble with women, that's why they
      don't make high-class executives; they haven't any sense of diplomacy.
      When the proper opportunity and occasion arises so it just comes in
      natural, why then I'll have a friendly little talk with him and&mdash;and&mdash;Was
      that Tinka hollering up-stairs? She ought to been asleep, long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He prowled through the living-room, and stood in the sun-parlor, that
      glass-walled room of wicker chairs and swinging couch in which they loafed
      on Sunday afternoons. Outside only the lights of Doppelbrau's house and
      the dim presence of Babbitt's favorite elm broke the softness of April
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good visit with the boy. Getting over feeling cranky, way I did this
      morning. And restless. Though, by golly, I will have a few days alone with
      Paul in Maine! . . . That devil Zilla! . . . But . . . Ted's all right.
      Whole family all right. And good business. Not many fellows make four
      hundred and fifty bucks, practically half of a thousand dollars easy as I
      did to-day! Maybe when we all get to rowing it's just as much my fault as
      it is theirs. Oughtn't to get grouchy like I do. But&mdash;Wish I'd been a
      pioneer, same as my grand-dad. But then, wouldn't have a house like this.
      I&mdash;Oh, gosh, I DON'T KNOW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought moodily of Paul Riesling, of their youth together, of the girls
      they had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Babbitt had graduated from the State University, twenty-four years
      ago, he had intended to be a lawyer. He had been a ponderous debater in
      college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor
      of the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He
      saved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash. The
      lively Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study
      violin, next month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled by
      Zilla Colbeck, who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and
      gaily wagging finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul's
      second cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her
      capacity by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was
      going to be governor some day. Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy,
      Myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young
      dandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith&mdash;an ancient
      settlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred
      thousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the
      Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he
      was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study
      law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice Girl&mdash;one
      didn't kiss her, one didn't &ldquo;think about her that way at all&rdquo; unless one
      was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She was always
      ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his discourses on the
      great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom he would defend
      against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at Banquets, the
      inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when he was weary and soft-minded, he saw that she had been
      weeping. She had been left out of a party given by Zilla. Somehow her head
      was on his shoulder and he was kissing away the tears&mdash;and she raised
      her head to say trustingly, &ldquo;Now that we're engaged, shall we be married
      soon or shall we wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Engaged? It was his first hint of it. His affection for this brown tender
      woman thing went cold and fearful, but he could not hurt her, could not
      abuse her trust. He mumbled something about waiting, and escaped. He
      walked for an hour, trying to find a way of telling her that it was a
      mistake. Often, in the month after, he got near to telling her, but it was
      pleasant to have a girl in his arms, and less and less could he insult her
      by blurting that he didn't love her. He himself had no doubt. The evening
      before his marriage was an agony, and the morning wild with the desire to
      flee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made him what is known as a Good Wife. She was loyal, industrious, and
      at rare times merry. She passed from a feeble disgust at their closer
      relations into what promised to be ardent affection, but it drooped into
      bored routine. Yet she existed only for him and for the children, and she
      was as sorry, as worried as himself, when he gave up the law and trudged
      on in a rut of listing real estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor kid, she hasn't had much better time than I have,&rdquo; Babbitt
      reflected, standing in the dark sun-parlor. &ldquo;But&mdash;I wish I could 've
      had a whirl at law and politics. Seen what I could do. Well&mdash;Maybe
      I've made more money as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the living-room but before he settled down he smoothed his
      wife's hair, and she glanced up, happy and somewhat surprised.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HE solemnly finished the last copy of the American Magazine, while his
      wife sighed, laid away her darning, and looked enviously at the lingerie
      designs in a women's magazine. The room was very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a room which observed the best Floral Heights standards. The gray
      walls were divided into artificial paneling by strips of white-enameled
      pine. From the Babbitts' former house had come two much-carved
      rocking-chairs, but the other chairs were new, very deep and restful,
      upholstered in blue and gold-striped velvet. A blue velvet davenport faced
      the fireplace, and behind it was a cherrywood table and a tall piano-lamp
      with a shade of golden silk. (Two out of every three houses in Floral
      Heights had before the fireplace a davenport, a mahogany table real or
      imitation, and a piano-lamp or a reading-lamp with a shade of yellow or
      rose silk.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table was a runner of gold-threaded Chinese fabric, four magazines,
      a silver box containing cigarette-crumbs, and three &ldquo;gift-books&rdquo;&mdash;large,
      expensive editions of fairy-tales illustrated by English artists and as
      yet unread by any Babbitt save Tinka.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner by the front windows was a large cabinet Victrola. (Eight out
      of every nine Floral Heights houses had a cabinet phonograph.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the pictures, hung in the exact center of each gray panel, were a
      red and black imitation English hunting-print, an anemic imitation
      boudoir-print with a French caption of whose morality Babbitt had always
      been rather suspicious, and a &ldquo;hand-colored&rdquo; photograph of a Colonial room&mdash;rag
      rug, maiden spinning, cat demure before a white fireplace. (Nineteen out
      of every twenty houses in Floral Heights had either a hunting-print, a
      Madame Feit la Toilette print, a colored photograph of a New England
      house, a photograph of a Rocky Mountain, or all four.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a room as superior in comfort to the &ldquo;parlor&rdquo; of Babbitt's boyhood
      as his motor was superior to his father's buggy. Though there was nothing
      in the room that was interesting, there was nothing that was offensive. It
      was as neat, and as negative, as a block of artificial ice. The fireplace
      was unsoftened by downy ashes or by sooty brick; the brass fire-irons were
      of immaculate polish; and the grenadier andirons were like samples in a
      shop, desolate, unwanted, lifeless things of commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the wall was a piano, with another piano-lamp, but no one used it
      save Tinka. The hard briskness of the phonograph contented them; their
      store of jazz records made them feel wealthy and cultured; and all they
      knew of creating music was the nice adjustment of a bamboo needle. The
      books on the table were unspotted and laid in rigid parallels; not one
      corner of the carpet-rug was curled; and nowhere was there a hockey-stick,
      a torn picture-book, an old cap, or a gregarious and disorganizing dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, Babbitt never read with absorption. He was concentrated enough at
      the office but here he crossed his legs and fidgeted. When his story was
      interesting he read the best, that is the funniest, paragraphs to his
      wife; when it did not hold him he coughed, scratched his ankles and his
      right ear, thrust his left thumb into his vest pocket, jingled his silver,
      whirled the cigar-cutter and the keys on one end of his watch chain,
      yawned, rubbed his nose, and found errands to do. He went upstairs to put
      on his slippers&mdash;his elegant slippers of seal-brown, shaped like
      medieval shoes. He brought up an apple from the barrel which stood by the
      trunk-closet in the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apple a day keeps the doctor away,&rdquo; he enlightened Mrs. Babbitt, for
      quite the first time in fourteen hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apple is Nature's best regulator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble with women is, they never have sense enough to form regular
      habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always nibbling and eating between meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; She looked up from her reading. &ldquo;Did you have a light lunch
      to-day, like you were going to? I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This malicious and unprovoked attack astounded him. &ldquo;Well, maybe it wasn't
      as light as&mdash;Went to lunch with Paul and didn't have much chance to
      diet. Oh, you needn't to grin like a chessy cat! If it wasn't for me
      watching out and keeping an eye on our diet&mdash;I'm the only member of
      this family that appreciates the value of oatmeal for breakfast. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stooped over her story while he piously sliced and gulped down the
      apple, discoursing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I've done: cut down my smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had kind of a run-in with Graff in the office. He's getting too darn
      fresh. I'll stand for a good deal, but once in a while I got to assert my
      authority, and I jumped him. 'Stan,' I said&mdash;Well, I told him just
      exactly where he got off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny kind of a day. Makes you feel restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wellllllllll, uh&mdash;&rdquo; That sleepiest sound in the world, the terminal
      yawn. Mrs. Babbitt yawned with it, and looked grateful as he droned, &ldquo;How
      about going to bed, eh? Don't suppose Rone and Ted will be in till all
      hours. Yep, funny kind of a day; not terribly warm but yet&mdash;Gosh, I'd
      like&mdash;Some day I'm going to take a long motor trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we'd enjoy that,&rdquo; she yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked away from her as he realized that he did not wish to have her go
      with him. As he locked doors and tried windows and set the heat regulator
      so that the furnace-drafts would open automatically in the morning, he
      sighed a little, heavy with a lonely feeling which perplexed and
      frightened him. So absent-minded was he that he could not remember which
      window-catches he had inspected, and through the darkness, fumbling at
      unseen perilous chairs, he crept back to try them all over again. His feet
      were loud on the steps as he clumped upstairs at the end of this great and
      treacherous day of veiled rebellions.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Before breakfast he always reverted to up-state village boyhood, and
      shrank from the complex urban demands of shaving, bathing, deciding
      whether the current shirt was clean enough for another day. Whenever he
      stayed home in the evening he went to bed early, and thriftily got ahead
      in those dismal duties. It was his luxurious custom to shave while sitting
      snugly in a tubful of hot water. He may be viewed to-night as a plump,
      smooth, pink, baldish, podgy goodman, robbed of the importance of
      spectacles, squatting in breast-high water, scraping his lather-smeared
      cheeks with a safety-razor like a tiny lawn-mower, and with melancholy
      dignity clawing through the water to recover a slippery and active piece
      of soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lulled to dreaming by the caressing warmth. The light fell on the
      inner surface of the tub in a pattern of delicate wrinkled lines which
      slipped with a green sparkle over the curving porcelain as the clear water
      trembled. Babbitt lazily watched it; noted that along the silhouette of
      his legs against the radiance on the bottom of the tub, the shadows of the
      air-bubbles clinging to the hairs were reproduced as strange jungle
      mosses. He patted the water, and the reflected light capsized and leaped
      and volleyed. He was content and childish. He played. He shaved a swath
      down the calf of one plump leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drain-pipe was dripping, a dulcet and lively song: drippety drip drip
      dribble, drippety drip drip drip. He was enchanted by it. He looked at the
      solid tub, the beautiful nickel taps, the tiled walls of the room, and
      felt virtuous in the possession of this splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself and spoke gruffly to his bath-things. &ldquo;Come here! You've
      done enough fooling!&rdquo; he reproved the treacherous soap, and defied the
      scratchy nail-brush with &ldquo;Oh, you would, would you!&rdquo; He soaped himself,
      and rinsed himself, and austerely rubbed himself; he noted a hole in the
      Turkish towel, and meditatively thrust a finger through it, and marched
      back to the bedroom, a grave and unbending citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of gorgeous abandon, a flash of melodrama such as he
      found in traffic-driving, when he laid out a clean collar, discovered that
      it was frayed in front, and tore it up with a magnificent yeeeeeing sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most important of all was the preparation of his bed and the
      sleeping-porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not known whether he enjoyed his sleeping-porch because of the fresh
      air or because it was the standard thing to have a sleeping-porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was an Elk, a Booster, and a member of the Chamber of Commerce,
      just as the priests of the Presbyterian Church determined his every
      religious belief and the senators who controlled the Republican Party
      decided in little smoky rooms in Washington what he should think about
      disarmament, tariff, and Germany, so did the large national advertisers
      fix the surface of his life, fix what he believed to be his individuality.
      These standard advertised wares&mdash;toothpastes, socks, tires, cameras,
      instantaneous hot-water heaters&mdash;were his symbols and proofs of
      excellence; at first the signs, then the substitutes, for joy and passion
      and wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of these advertised tokens of financial and social success was
      more significant than a sleeping-porch with a sun-parlor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rites of preparing for bed were elaborate and unchanging. The blankets
      had to be tucked in at the foot of his cot. (Also, the reason why the maid
      hadn't tucked in the blankets had to be discussed with Mrs. Babbitt.) The
      rag rug was adjusted so that his bare feet would strike it when he arose
      in the morning. The alarm clock was wound. The hot-water bottle was filled
      and placed precisely two feet from the bottom of the cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tremendous undertakings yielded to his determination; one by one
      they were announced to Mrs. Babbitt and smashed through to accomplishment.
      At last his brow cleared, and in his &ldquo;Gnight!&rdquo; rang virile power. But
      there was yet need of courage. As he sank into sleep, just at the first
      exquisite relaxation, the Doppelbrau car came home. He bounced into
      wakefulness, lamenting, &ldquo;Why the devil can't some people never get to bed
      at a reasonable hour?&rdquo; So familiar was he with the process of putting up
      his own car that he awaited each step like an able executioner condemned
      to his own rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car insultingly cheerful on the driveway. The car door opened and
      banged shut, then the garage door slid open, grating on the sill, and the
      car door again. The motor raced for the climb up into the garage and raced
      once more, explosively, before it was shut off. A final opening and
      slamming of the car door. Silence then, a horrible silence filled with
      waiting, till the leisurely Mr. Doppelbrau had examined the state of his
      tires and had at last shut the garage door. Instantly, for Babbitt, a
      blessed state of oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment In the city of Zenith, Horace Updike was making love to
      Lucile McKelvey in her mauve drawing-room on Royal Ridge, after their
      return from a lecture by an eminent English novelist. Updike was Zenith's
      professional bachelor; a slim-waisted man of forty-six with an effeminate
      voice and taste in flowers, cretonnes, and flappers. Mrs. McKelvey was
      red-haired, creamy, discontented, exquisite, rude, and honest. Updike
      tried his invariable first maneuver&mdash;touching her nervous wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be an idiot!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind awfully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! That's what I mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He changed to conversation. He was famous at conversation. He spoke
      reasonably of psychoanalysis, Long Island polo, and the Ming platter he
      had found in Vancouver. She promised to meet him in Deauville, the coming
      summer, &ldquo;though,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;it's becoming too dreadfully banal; nothing
      but Americans and frowsy English baronesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at that moment in Zenith, a cocaine-runner and a prostitute were
      drinking cocktails in Healey Hanson's saloon on Front Street. Since
      national prohibition was now in force, and since Zenith was notoriously
      law-abiding, they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent by
      drinking them out of tea-cups. The lady threw her cup at the
      cocaine-runner's head. He worked his revolver out of the pocket in his
      sleeve, and casually murdered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment in Zenith, two men sat in a laboratory. For thirty-seven
      hours now they had been working on a report of their investigations of
      synthetic rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment in Zenith, there was a conference of four union officials
      as to whether the twelve thousand coal-miners within a hundred miles of
      the city should strike. Of these men one resembled a testy and prosperous
      grocer, one a Yankee carpenter, one a soda-clerk, and one a Russian Jewish
      actor The Russian Jew quoted Kautsky, Gene Debs, and Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a G. A. R. veteran was dying. He had come from the Civil
      War straight to a farm which, though it was officially within the
      city-limits of Zenith, was primitive as the backwoods. He had never ridden
      in a motor car, never seen a bath-tub, never read any book save the Bible,
      McGuffey's readers, and religious tracts; and he believed that the earth
      is flat, that the English are the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, and that the
      United States is a democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the steel and cement town which composed the factory of the
      Pullmore Tractor Company of Zenith was running on night shift to fill an
      order of tractors for the Polish army. It hummed like a million bees,
      glared through its wide windows like a volcano. Along the high wire
      fences, searchlights played on cinder-lined yards, switch-tracks, and
      armed guards on patrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Mike Monday was finishing a meeting. Mr. Monday, the
      distinguished evangelist, the best-known Protestant pontiff in America,
      had once been a prize-fighter. Satan had not dealt justly with him. As a
      prize-fighter he gained nothing but his crooked nose, his celebrated
      vocabulary, and his stage-presence. The service of the Lord had been more
      profitable. He was about to retire with a fortune. It had been well
      earned, for, to quote his last report, &ldquo;Rev. Mr. Monday, the Prophet with
      a Punch, has shown that he is the world's greatest salesman of salvation,
      and that by efficient organization the overhead of spiritual regeneration
      may be kept down to an unprecedented rock-bottom basis. He has converted
      over two hundred thousand lost and priceless souls at an average cost of
      less than ten dollars a head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the larger cities of the land, only Zenith had hesitated to submit its
      vices to Mike Monday and his expert reclamation corps. The more
      enterprising organizations of the city had voted to invite him&mdash;Mr.
      George F. Babbitt had once praised him in a speech at the Boosters' Club.
      But there was opposition from certain Episcopalian and Congregationalist
      ministers, those renegades whom Mr. Monday so finely called &ldquo;a bunch of
      gospel-pushers with dish-water instead of blood, a gang of squealers that
      need more dust on the knees of their pants and more hair on their skinny
      old chests.&rdquo; This opposition had been crushed when the secretary of the
      Chamber of Commerce had reported to a committee of manufacturers that in
      every city where he had appeared, Mr. Monday had turned the minds of
      workmen from wages and hours to higher things, and thus averted strikes.
      He was immediately invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expense fund of forty thousand dollars had been underwritten; out on
      the County Fair Grounds a Mike Monday Tabernacle had been erected, to seat
      fifteen thousand people. In it the prophet was at this moment concluding
      his message:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a lot of smart college professors and tea-guzzling slobs in this
      burg that say I'm a roughneck and a never-wuzzer and my knowledge of
      history is not-yet. Oh, there's a gang of woolly-whiskered book-lice that
      think they know more than Almighty God, and prefer a lot of Hun science
      and smutty German criticism to the straight and simple Word of God. Oh,
      there's a swell bunch of Lizzie boys and lemon-suckers and pie-faces and
      infidels and beer-bloated scribblers that love to fire off their filthy
      mouths and yip that Mike Monday is vulgar and full of mush. Those pups are
      saying now that I hog the gospel-show, that I'm in it for the coin. Well,
      now listen, folks! I'm going to give those birds a chance! They can stand
      right up here and tell me to my face that I'm a galoot and a liar and a
      hick! Only if they do&mdash;if they do!&mdash;don't faint with surprise if
      some of those rum-dumm liars get one good swift poke from Mike, with all
      the kick of God's Flaming Righteousness behind the wallop! Well, come on,
      folks! Who says it? Who says Mike Monday is a fourflush and a yahoo? Huh?
      Don't I see anybody standing up? Well, there you are! Now I guess the
      folks in this man's town will quit listening to all this kyoodling from
      behind the fence; I guess you'll quit listening to the guys that pan and
      roast and kick and beef, and vomit out filthy atheism; and all of you 'll
      come in, with every grain of pep and reverence you got, and boost all
      together for Jesus Christ and his everlasting mercy and tenderness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, and Dr. Kurt Yavitch, the
      histologist (whose report on the destruction of epithelial cells under
      radium had made the name of Zenith known in Munich, Prague, and Rome),
      were talking in Doane's library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zenith's a city with gigantic power&mdash;gigantic buildings, gigantic
      machines, gigantic transportation,&rdquo; meditated Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate your city. It has standardized all the beauty out of life. It is
      one big railroad station&mdash;with all the people taking tickets for the
      best cemeteries,&rdquo; Dr. Yavitch said placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane roused. &ldquo;I'm hanged if it is! You make me sick, Kurt, with your
      perpetual whine about 'standardization.' Don't you suppose any other
      nation is 'standardized?' Is anything more standardized than England, with
      every house that can afford it having the same muffins at the same
      tea-hour, and every retired general going to exactly the same evensong at
      the same gray stone church with a square tower, and every golfing prig in
      Harris tweeds saying 'Right you are!' to every other prosperous ass? Yet I
      love England. And for standardization&mdash;just look at the sidewalk
      cafes in France and the love-making in Italy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Standardization is excellent, per se. When I buy an Ingersoll watch or a
      Ford, I get a better tool for less money, and I know precisely what I'm
      getting, and that leaves me more time and energy to be individual in. And&mdash;I
      remember once in London I saw a picture of an American suburb, in a
      toothpaste ad on the back of the Saturday Evening Post&mdash;an elm-lined
      snowy street of these new houses, Georgian some of 'em, or with low raking
      roofs and&mdash;The kind of street you'd find here in Zenith, say in
      Floral Heights. Open. Trees. Grass. And I was homesick! There's no other
      country in the world that has such pleasant houses. And I don't care if
      they ARE standardized. It's a corking standard!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, what I fight in Zenith is standardization of thought, and, of course,
      the traditions of competition. The real villains of the piece are the
      clean, kind, industrious Family Men who use every known brand of trickery
      and cruelty to insure the prosperity of their cubs. The worst thing about
      these fellows is that they're so good and, in their work at least, so
      intelligent. You can't hate them properly, and yet their standardized
      minds are the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this boosting&mdash;Sneakingly I have a notion that Zenith is a
      better place to live in than Manchester or Glasgow or Lyons or Berlin or
      Turin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not, and I have lift in most of them,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Yavitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, matter of taste. Personally, I prefer a city with a future so
      unknown that it excites my imagination. But what I particularly want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Dr. Yavitch, &ldquo;are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't the
      slightest idea what you want. I, being a revolutionist, know exactly what
      I want&mdash;and what I want now is a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment in Zenith, Jake Offutt, the politician, and Henry T.
      Thompson were in conference. Offutt suggested, &ldquo;The thing to do is to get
      your fool son-in-law, Babbitt, to put it over. He's one of these patriotic
      guys. When he grabs a piece of property for the gang, he makes it look
      like we were dyin' of love for the dear peepul, and I do love to buy
      respectability&mdash;reasonable. Wonder how long we can keep it up, Hank?
      We're safe as long as the good little boys like George Babbitt and all the
      nice respectable labor-leaders think you and me are rugged patriots.
      There's swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city
      working to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and
      rallying to our banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation, whenever
      some squealer like this fellow Seneca Doane comes along! Honest, Hank, a
      smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if he didn't milk
      cattle like them, when they come around mooing for it! But the Traction
      gang can't get away with grand larceny like it used to. I wonder when&mdash;Hank,
      I wish we could fix some way to run this fellow Seneca Doane out of town.
      It's him or us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment in Zenith, three hundred and forty or fifty thousand
      Ordinary People were asleep, a vast unpenetrated shadow. In the slum
      beyond the railroad tracks, a young man who for six months had sought work
      turned on the gas and killed himself and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Lloyd Mallam, the poet, owner of the Hafiz Book Shop, was
      finishing a rondeau to show how diverting was life amid the feuds of
      medieval Florence, but how dull it was in so obvious a place as Zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at that moment George F. Babbitt turned ponderously in bed&mdash;the
      last turn, signifying that he'd had enough of this worried business of
      falling asleep and was about it in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he was in the magic dream. He was somewhere among unknown people
      who laughed at him. He slipped away, ran down the paths of a midnight
      garden, and at the gate the fairy child was waiting. Her dear and tranquil
      hand caressed his cheek. He was gallant and wise and well-beloved; warm
      ivory were her arms; and beyond perilous moors the brave sea glittered.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE great events of Babbitt's spring were the secret buying of real-estate
      options in Linton for certain street-traction officials, before the public
      announcement that the Linton Avenue Car Line would be extended, and a
      dinner which was, as he rejoiced to his wife, not only &ldquo;a regular society
      spread but a real sure-enough highbrow affair, with some of the keenest
      intellects and the brightest bunch of little women in town.&rdquo; It was so
      absorbing an occasion that he almost forgot his desire to run off to Maine
      with Paul Riesling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he had been born in the village of Catawba, Babbitt had risen to
      that metropolitan social plane on which hosts have as many as four people
      at dinner without planning it for more than an evening or two. But a
      dinner of twelve, with flowers from the florist's and all the cut-glass
      out, staggered even the Babbitts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two weeks they studied, debated, and arbitrated the list of guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt marveled, &ldquo;Of course we're up-to-date ourselves, but still, think
      of us entertaining a famous poet like Chum Frink, a fellow that on nothing
      but a poem or so every day and just writing a few advertisements pulls
      down fifteen thousand berries a year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Howard Littlefield. Do you know, the other evening Eunice told
      me her papa speaks three languages!&rdquo; said Mrs. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! That's nothing! So do I&mdash;American, baseball, and poker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it's nice to be funny about a matter like that. Think how
      wonderful it must be to speak three languages, and so useful and&mdash;And
      with people like that, I don't see why we invite the Orville Joneses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, Orville is a mighty up-and-coming fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but&mdash;A laundry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll admit a laundry hasn't got the class of poetry or real estate, but
      just the same, Orvy is mighty deep. Ever start him spieling about
      gardening? Say, that fellow can tell you the name of every kind of tree,
      and some of their Greek and Latin names too! Besides, we owe the Joneses a
      dinner. Besides, gosh, we got to have some boob for audience, when a bunch
      of hot-air artists like Frink and Littlefield get going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear&mdash;I meant to speak of this&mdash;I do think that as host
      you ought to sit back and listen, and let your guests have a chance to
      talk once in a while!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do, do you! Sure! I talk all the time! And I'm just a business
      man&mdash;oh sure!&mdash;I'm no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I
      haven't anything to spring! Well, let me tell you, just the other day your
      darn Chum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought
      about the Springfield school-bond issue. And who told him? I did! You bet
      your life I told him! Little me! I certainly did! He came up and asked me,
      and I told him all about it! You bet! And he was darn glad to listen to me
      and&mdash;Duty as a host! I guess I know my duty as a host and let me tell
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the Orville Joneses were invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the dinner, Mrs. Babbitt was restive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, George, I want you to be sure and be home early tonight. Remember,
      you have to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh. I see by the Advocate that the Presbyterian General Assembly has
      voted to quit the Interchurch World Movement. That&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! Did you hear what I said? You must be home in time to dress
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress? Hell! I'm dressed now! Think I'm going down to the office in my
      B.V.D.'s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not have you talking indecently before the children! And you do
      have to put on your dinner-jacket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you mean my Tux. I tell you, of all the doggone nonsensical
      nuisances that was ever invented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes later, after Babbitt had wailed, &ldquo;Well, I don't know whether
      I'm going to dress or NOT&rdquo; in a manner which showed that he was going to
      dress, the discussion moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, George, you mustn't forget to call in at Vecchia's on the way home
      and get the ice cream. Their delivery-wagon is broken down, and I don't
      want to trust them to send it by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! You told me that before breakfast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want you to forget. I'll be working my head off all day
      long, training the girl that's to help with the dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All nonsense, anyway, hiring an extra girl for the feed. Matilda could
      perfectly well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I have to go out and buy the flowers, and fix them, and set
      the table, and order the salted almonds, and look at the chickens, and
      arrange for the children to have their supper upstairs and&mdash;And I
      simply must depend on you to go to Vecchia's for the ice cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All riiiiiight! Gosh, I'm going to get it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have to do is to go in and say you want the ice cream that Mrs.
      Babbitt ordered yesterday by 'phone, and it will be all ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At ten-thirty she telephoned to him not to forget the ice cream from
      Vecchia's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised and blasted then by a thought. He wondered whether Floral
      Heights dinners were worth the hideous toil involved. But he repented the
      sacrilege in the excitement of buying the materials for cocktails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was the manner of obtaining alcohol under the reign of
      righteousness and prohibition:
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business center
      into the tangled byways of Old Town&mdash;jagged blocks filled with sooty
      warehouses and lofts; on into The Arbor, once a pleasant orchard but now a
      morass of lodging-houses, tenements, and brothels. Exquisite shivers
      chilled his spine and stomach, and he looked at every policeman with
      intense innocence, as one who loved the law, and admired the Force, and
      longed to stop and play with them. He parked his car a block from Healey
      Hanson's saloon, worrying, &ldquo;Well, rats, if anybody did see me, they'd
      think I was here on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He entered a place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days,
      with a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind, a
      pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something
      which resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something
      which resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large crowd
      which two men always give in a saloon. The bartender, a tall pale Swede
      with a diamond in his lilac scarf, stared at Babbitt as he stalked plumply
      up to the bar and whispered, &ldquo;I'd, uh&mdash;Friend of Hanson's sent me
      here. Like to get some gin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender gazed down on him in the manner of an outraged bishop. &ldquo;I
      guess you got the wrong place, my friend. We sell nothing but soft drinks
      here.&rdquo; He cleaned the bar with a rag which would itself have done with a
      little cleaning, and glared across his mechanically moving elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old dreamer at the table petitioned the bartender, &ldquo;Say, Oscar,
      listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oscar did not listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, say, Oscar, listen, will yuh? Say, lis-sen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The decayed and drowsy voice of the loafer, the agreeable stink of
      beer-dregs, threw a spell of inanition over Babbitt. The bartender moved
      grimly toward the crowd of two men. Babbitt followed him as delicately as
      a cat, and wheedled, &ldquo;Say, Oscar, I want to speak to Mr. Hanson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whajuh wanta see him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just want to talk to him. Here's my card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful card, an engraved card, a card in the blackest black
      and the sharpest red, announcing that Mr. George F. Babbitt was Estates,
      Insurance, Rents. The bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds,
      and read it as though it were a hundred words long. He did not bend from
      his episcopal dignity, but he growled, &ldquo;I'll see if he's around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet
      sharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and burning
      brown trousers&mdash;Mr. Healey Hanson. Mr. Hanson said only &ldquo;Yuh?&rdquo; but
      his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried Babbitt's soul, and he seemed
      not at all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he had
      admitted to every acquaintance at the Athletic Club) Babbitt had paid a
      hundred and twenty-five dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad meet you, Mr. Hanson. Say, uh&mdash;I'm George Babbitt of the
      Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. I'm a great friend of Jake Offutt's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, uh, I'm going to have a party, and Jake told me you'd be able to fix
      me up with a little gin.&rdquo; In alarm, in obsequiousness, as Hanson's eyes
      grew more bored, &ldquo;You telephone to Jake about me, if you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the back
      room, and strolled away. Babbitt melodramatically crept into an apartment
      containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery calendar, and a
      smell. He waited. Thrice he saw Healey Hanson saunter through, humming,
      hands in pockets, ignoring him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Babbitt had modified his valiant morning vow, &ldquo;I won't pay
      one cent over seven dollars a quart&rdquo; to &ldquo;I might pay ten.&rdquo; On Hanson's
      next weary entrance he besought &ldquo;Could you fix that up?&rdquo; Hanson scowled,
      and grated, &ldquo;Just a minute&mdash;Pete's sake&mdash;just a min-ute!&rdquo; In
      growing meekness Babbitt went on waiting till Hanson casually reappeared
      with a quart of gin&mdash;what is euphemistically known as a quart&mdash;in
      his disdainful long white hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve bucks,&rdquo; he snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, uh, but say, cap'n, Jake thought you'd be able to fix me up for
      eight or nine a bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nup. Twelve. This is the real stuff, smuggled from Canada. This is none
      o' your neutral spirits with a drop of juniper extract,&rdquo; the honest
      merchant said virtuously. &ldquo;Twelve bones&mdash;if you want it. Course y'
      understand I'm just doing this anyway as a friend of Jake's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! Sure! I understand!&rdquo; Babbitt gratefully held out twelve dollars. He
      felt honored by contact with greatness as Hanson yawned, stuffed the
      bills, uncounted, into his radiant vest, and swaggered away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a number of titillations out of concealing the gin-bottle under his
      coat and out of hiding it in his desk. All afternoon he snorted and
      chuckled and gurgled over his ability to &ldquo;give the Boys a real shot in the
      arm to-night.&rdquo; He was, in fact, so exhilarated that he was within a block
      of his house before he remembered that there was a certain matter,
      mentioned by his wife, of fetching ice cream from Vecchia's. He explained,
      &ldquo;Well, darn it&mdash;&rdquo; and drove back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vecchia was not a caterer, he was The Caterer of Zenith. Most coming-out
      parties were held in the white and gold ballroom of the Maison Vecchia; at
      all nice teas the guests recognized the five kinds of Vecchia sandwiches
      and the seven kinds of Vecchia cakes; and all really smart dinners ended,
      as on a resolving chord, in Vecchia Neapolitan ice cream in one of the
      three reliable molds&mdash;the melon mold, the round mold like a layer
      cake, and the long brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vecchia's shop had pale blue woodwork, tracery of plaster roses,
      attendants in frilled aprons, and glass shelves of &ldquo;kisses&rdquo; with all the
      refinement that inheres in whites of eggs. Babbitt felt heavy and thick
      amid this professional daintiness, and as he waited for the ice cream he
      decided, with hot prickles at the back of his neck, that a girl customer
      was giggling at him. He went home in a touchy temper. The first thing he
      heard was his wife's agitated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! DID you remember to go to Vecchia's and get the ice cream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! Look here! Do I ever forget to do things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Often!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, it's darn seldom I do, and it certainly makes me tired, after
      going into a pink-tea joint like Vecchia's and having to stand around
      looking at a lot of half-naked young girls, all rouged up like they were
      sixty and eating a lot of stuff that simply ruins their stomachs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's too bad about you! I've noticed how you hate to look at pretty
      girls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a jar Babbitt realized that his wife was too busy to be impressed by
      that moral indignation with which males rule the world, and he went humbly
      up-stairs to dress. He had an impression of a glorified dining-room, of
      cut-glass, candles, polished wood, lace, silver, roses. With the awed
      swelling of the heart suitable to so grave a business as giving a dinner,
      he slew the temptation to wear his plaited dress-shirt for a fourth time,
      took out an entirely fresh one, tightened his black bow, and rubbed his
      patent-leather pumps with a handkerchief. He glanced with pleasure at his
      garnet and silver studs. He smoothed and patted his ankles, transformed by
      silk socks from the sturdy shanks of George Babbitt to the elegant limbs
      of what is called a Clubman. He stood before the pier-glass, viewing his
      trim dinner-coat, his beautiful triple-braided trousers; and murmured in
      lyric beatitude, &ldquo;By golly, I don't look so bad. I certainly don't look
      like Catawba. If the hicks back home could see me in this rig, they'd have
      a fit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved majestically down to mix the cocktails. As he chipped ice, as he
      squeezed oranges, as he collected vast stores of bottles, glasses, and
      spoons at the sink in the pantry, he felt as authoritative as the
      bartender at Healey Hanson's saloon. True, Mrs. Babbitt said he was under
      foot, and Matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by him,
      elbowed him, shrieked &ldquo;Pleasopn door,&rdquo; as they tottered through with
      trays, but in this high moment he ignored them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the new bottle of gin, his cellar consisted of one half-bottle of
      Bourbon whisky, a quarter of a bottle of Italian vermouth, and
      approximately one hundred drops of orange bitters. He did not possess a
      cocktail-shaker. A shaker was proof of dissipation, the symbol of a
      Drinker, and Babbitt disliked being known as a Drinker even more than he
      liked a Drink. He mixed by pouring from an ancient gravy-boat into a
      handleless pitcher; he poured with a noble dignity, holding his alembics
      high beneath the powerful Mazda globe, his face hot, his shirt-front a
      glaring white, the copper sink a scoured red-gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tasted the sacred essence. &ldquo;Now, by golly, if that isn't pretty near
      one fine old cocktail! Kind of a Bronx, and yet like a Manhattan. Ummmmmm!
      Hey, Myra, want a little nip before the folks come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bustling into the dining-room, moving each glass a quarter of an inch,
      rushing back with resolution implacable on her face her gray and
      silver-lace party frock protected by a denim towel, Mrs. Babbitt glared at
      him, and rebuked him, &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; in a loose, jocose manner, &ldquo;I think the old man will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cocktail filled him with a whirling exhilaration behind which he was
      aware of devastating desires&mdash;to rush places in fast motors, to kiss
      girls, to sing, to be witty. He sought to regain his lost dignity by
      announcing to Matilda:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to stick this pitcher of cocktails in the refrigerator. Be sure
      you don't upset any of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be sure now. Don't go putting anything on this top shelf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be&mdash;&rdquo; He was dizzy. His voice was thin and distant. &ldquo;Whee!&rdquo;
       With enormous impressiveness he commanded, &ldquo;Well, be sure now,&rdquo; and minced
      into the safety of the living-room. He wondered whether he could persuade
      &ldquo;as slow a bunch as Myra and the Littlefields to go some place aft' dinner
      and raise Cain and maybe dig up smore booze.&rdquo; He perceived that he had
      gifts of profligacy which had been neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple for
      whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray emptiness had
      replaced the purple swirling in Babbitt's head, and he had to force the
      tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on Floral Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who furnished
      publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction Company; Vergil
      Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and in the Boosters'
      Club; Eddie Swanson the agent for the Javelin Motor Car, who lived across
      the street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily White Laundry, which
      justly announced itself &ldquo;the biggest, busiest, bulliest cleanerie shoppe
      in Zenith.&rdquo; But, naturally, the most distinguished of all was T.
      Cholmondeley Frink, who was not only the author of &ldquo;Poemulations,&rdquo; which,
      syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading newspapers, gave him one of the
      largest audiences of any poet in the world, but also an optimistic
      lecturer and the creator of &ldquo;Ads that Add.&rdquo; Despite the searching
      philosophy and high morality of his verses, they were humorous and easily
      understood by any child of twelve; and it added a neat air of pleasantry
      to them that they were set not as verse but as prose. Mr. Frink was known
      from Coast to Coast as &ldquo;Chum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With them were six wives, more or less&mdash;it was hard to tell, so early
      in the evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all
      said, &ldquo;Oh, ISN'T this nice!&rdquo; in the same tone of determined liveliness. To
      the eye, the men were less similar: Littlefield, a hedge-scholar, tall and
      horse-faced; Chum Frink, a trifle of a man with soft and mouse-like hair,
      advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on his eye-glasses;
      Vergil Gunch, broad, with coarse black hair en brosse; Eddie Swanson, a
      bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste for elegance by an
      evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass buttons; Orville Jones,
      a steady-looking, stubby, not very memorable person, with a hemp-colored
      toothbrush mustache. Yet they were all so well fed and clean, they all
      shouted &ldquo;'Evenin', Georgie!&rdquo; with such robustness, that they seemed to be
      cousins, and the strange thing is that the longer one knew the women, the
      less alike they seemed; while the longer one knew the men, the more alike
      their bold patterns appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drinking of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing. The
      company waited, uneasily, hopefully, agreeing in a strained manner that
      the weather had been rather warm and slightly cold, but still Babbitt said
      nothing about drinks. They became despondent. But when the late couple
      (the Swansons) had arrived, Babbitt hinted, &ldquo;Well, folks, do you think you
      could stand breaking the law a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at Chum Frink, the recognized lord of language. Frink pulled
      at his eye-glass cord as at a bell-rope, he cleared his throat and said
      that which was the custom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you, George: I'm a law-abiding man, but they do say Verg Gunch
      is a regular yegg, and of course he's bigger 'n I am, and I just can't
      figure out what I'd do if he tried to force me into anything criminal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gunch was roaring, &ldquo;Well, I'll take a chance&mdash;&rdquo; when Frink held up
      his hand and went on, &ldquo;So if Verg and you insist, Georgie, I'll park my
      car on the wrong side of the street, because I take it for granted that's
      the crime you're hinting at!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of laughter. Mrs. Jones asserted, &ldquo;Mr. Frink is
      simply too killing! You'd think he was so innocent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt clamored, &ldquo;How did you guess it, Chum? Well, you-all just wait a
      moment while I go out and get the&mdash;keys to your cars!&rdquo; Through a
      froth of merriment he brought the shining promise, the mighty tray of
      glasses with the cloudy yellow cocktails in the glass pitcher in the
      center. The men babbled, &ldquo;Oh, gosh, have a look!&rdquo; and &ldquo;This gets me right
      where I live!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let me at it!&rdquo; But Chum Frink, a traveled man and not
      unused to woes, was stricken by the thought that the potion might be
      merely fruit-juice with a little neutral spirits. He looked timorous as
      Babbitt, a moist and ecstatic almoner, held out a glass, but as he tasted
      it he piped, &ldquo;Oh, man, let me dream on! It ain't true, but don't waken me!
      Jus' lemme slumber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours before, Frink had completed a newspaper lyric beginning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sat alone and groused and thunk, and scratched my head and sighed and
      wunk, and groaned, There still are boobs, alack, who'd like the old-time
      gin-mill back; that den that makes a sage a loon, the vile and smelly old
      saloon! I'll never miss their poison booze, whilst I the bubbling spring
      can use, that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as any babe new-born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt drank with the others; his moment's depression was gone; he
      perceived that these were the best fellows in the world; he wanted to give
      them a thousand cocktails. &ldquo;Think you could stand another?&rdquo; he cried. The
      wives refused, with giggles, but the men, speaking in a wide, elaborate,
      enjoyable manner, gloated, &ldquo;Well, sooner than have you get sore at me,
      Georgie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got a little dividend coming,&rdquo; said Babbitt to each of them, and each
      intoned, &ldquo;Squeeze it, Georgie, squeeze it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about
      prohibition. The men leaned back on their heels, put their hands in their
      trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming profundity
      of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed statement about a
      matter of which he knows nothing whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I'll tell you,&rdquo; said Vergil Gunch; &ldquo;way I figure it is this, and I
      can speak by the book, because I've talked to a lot of doctors and fellows
      that ought to know, and the way I see it is that it's a good thing to get
      rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer and light
      wines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howard Littlefield observed, &ldquo;What isn't generally realized is that it's a
      dangerous prop'sition to invade the rights of personal liberty. Now, take
      this for instance: The King of&mdash;Bavaria? I think it was Bavaria&mdash;yes,
      Bavaria, it was&mdash;in 1862, March, 1862, he issued a proclamation
      against public grazing of live-stock. The peasantry had stood for
      overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this proclamation
      came out, they rebelled. Or it may have been Saxony. But it just goes to
      show the dangers of invading the rights of personal liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it&mdash;no one got a right to invade personal liberty,&rdquo; said
      Orville Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same, you don't want to forget prohibition is a mighty good
      thing for the working-classes. Keeps 'em from wasting their money and
      lowering their productiveness,&rdquo; said Vergil Gunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so. But the trouble is the manner of enforcement,&rdquo; insisted
      Howard Littlefield. &ldquo;Congress didn't understand the right system. Now, if
      I'd been running the thing, I'd have arranged it so that the drinker
      himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless
      workman&mdash;kept him from drinking&mdash;and yet not 've interfered with
      the rights&mdash;with the personal liberty&mdash;of fellows like
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,
      &ldquo;That's so, that would be the stunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to
      cocaine,&rdquo; sighed Eddie Swanson.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bobbed more violently, and groaned, &ldquo;That's so, there is a danger of
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chum Frink chanted, &ldquo;Oh, say, I got hold of a swell new receipt for
      home-made beer the other day. You take&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gunch interrupted, &ldquo;Wait! Let me tell you mine!&rdquo; Littlefield snorted,
      &ldquo;Beer! Rats! Thing to do is to ferment cider!&rdquo; Jones insisted, &ldquo;I've got
      the receipt that does the business!&rdquo; Swanson begged, &ldquo;Oh, say, lemme tell
      you the story&mdash;&rdquo; But Frink went on resolutely, &ldquo;You take and save the
      shells from peas, and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of shells and
      boil the mixture till&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; Frink hastened to
      finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, &ldquo;Dinner is served.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which
      should go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the
      living-room to the dining-room Vergil Gunch made them laugh by thundering,
      &ldquo;If I can't sit next to Myra Babbitt and hold her hand under the table, I
      won't play&mdash;I'm goin' home.&rdquo; In the dining-room they stood
      embarrassed while Mrs. Babbitt fluttered, &ldquo;Now, let me see&mdash;Oh, I was
      going to have some nice hand-painted place-cards for you but&mdash;Oh, let
      me see; Mr. Frink, you sit there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was in the best style of women's-magazine art, whereby the
      salad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible
      fried chicken resembled something else. Ordinarily the men found it hard
      to talk to the women; flirtation was an art unknown on Floral Heights, and
      the realms of offices and of kitchens had no alliances. But under the
      inspiration of the cocktails, conversation was violent. Each of the men
      still had a number of important things to say about prohibition, and now
      that each had a loyal listener in his dinner-partner he burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found a place where I can get all the hootch I want at eight a quart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars for
      ten cases of red-eye that proved to be nothing but water? Seems this
      fellow was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say there's a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at Detroit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I always say is&mdash;what a lot of folks don't realize about
      prohibition&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you get all this awful poison stuff&mdash;wood alcohol and
      everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I believe in it on principle, but I don't propose to have anybody
      telling me what I got to think and do. No American 'll ever stand for
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for Orville Jones&mdash;and
      he not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion anyway&mdash;to say,
      &ldquo;In fact, the whole thing about prohibition is this: it isn't the initial
      cost, it's the humidity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation
      become general.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was often and admiringly said of Vergil Gunch, &ldquo;Gee, that fellow can
      get away with murder! Why, he can pull a Raw One in mixed company and all
      the ladies 'll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if I crack anything
      that's just the least bit off color I get the razz for fair!&rdquo; Now Gunch
      delighted them by crying to Mrs. Eddie Swanson, youngest of the women,
      &ldquo;Louetta! I managed to pinch Eddie's doorkey out of his pocket, and what
      say you and me sneak across the street when the folks aren't looking? Got
      something,&rdquo; with a gorgeous leer, &ldquo;awful important to tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women wriggled, and Babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness. &ldquo;Say,
      folks, I wished I dared show you a book I borrowed from Doc Patten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, George! The idea!&rdquo; Mrs. Babbitt warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This book&mdash;racy isn't the word! It's some kind of an anthropological
      report about&mdash;about Customs, in the South Seas, and what it doesn't
      SAY! It's a book you can't buy. Verg, I'll lend it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me first!&rdquo; insisted Eddie Swanson. &ldquo;Sounds spicy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orville Jones announced, &ldquo;Say, I heard a Good One the other day about a
      coupla Swedes and their wives,&rdquo; and, in the best Jewish accent, he
      resolutely carried the Good One to a slightly disinfected ending. Gunch
      capped it. But the cocktails waned, the seekers dropped back into cautious
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chum Frink had recently been on a lecture-tour among the small towns, and
      he chuckled, &ldquo;Awful good to get back to civilization! I certainly been
      seeing some hick towns! I mean&mdash;Course the folks there are the best
      on earth, but, gee whiz, those Main Street burgs are slow, and you fellows
      can't hardly appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of live
      ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; exulted Orville Jones. &ldquo;They're the best folks on earth, those
      small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! Why, say, they can't
      talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo Ford, by heckalorum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right. They all talk about just the same things,&rdquo; said Eddie
      Swanson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't they, though! They just say the same things over and over,&rdquo; said
      Vergil Gunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's really remarkable. They seem to lack all power of looking at
      things impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about
      Fords and the weather and so on.&rdquo; said Howard Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, at that, you can't blame 'em. They haven't got any intellectual
      stimulus such as you get up here in the city,&rdquo; said Chum Frink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, that's right,&rdquo; said Babbitt. &ldquo;I don't want you highbrows to get
      stuck on yourselves but I must say it keeps a fellow right up on his toes
      to sit in with a poet and with Howard, the guy that put the con in
      economics! But these small-town boobs, with nobody but each other to talk
      to, no wonder they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech, and so
      balled-up in their thinking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orville Jones commented, &ldquo;And, then take our other advantages&mdash;the
      movies, frinstance. These Yapville sports think they're all-get-out if
      they have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your
      choice of a dozen diff'rent movies any evening you want to name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class
      hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger,&rdquo; said Eddie Swanson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same time,&rdquo; said Babbitt, &ldquo;no sense excusing these rube burgs too easy.
      Fellow's own fault if he doesn't show the initiative to up and beat it to
      the city, like we done&mdash;did. And, just speaking in confidence among
      friends, they're jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up to
      Catawba I have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought up
      with because I've more or less succeeded and they haven't. And if you talk
      natural to 'em, way we do here, and show finesse and what you might call a
      broad point of view, why, they think you're putting on side. There's my
      own half-brother Martin&mdash;runs the little ole general store my Dad
      used to keep. Say, I'll bet he don't know there is such a thing as a Tux&mdash;as
      a dinner-jacket. If he was to come in here now, he'd think we were a bunch
      of&mdash;of&mdash;Why, gosh, I swear, he wouldn't know what to think! Yes,
      sir, they're jealous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chum Frink agreed, &ldquo;That's so. But what I mind is their lack of culture
      and appreciation of the Beautiful&mdash;if you'll excuse me for being
      highbrow. Now, I like to give a high-class lecture, and read some of my
      best poetry&mdash;not the newspaper stuff but the magazine things. But
      say, when I get out in the tall grass, there's nothing will take but a lot
      of cheesy old stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge
      in it here, he'd get the gate so fast it would make his head swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vergil Gunch summed it up: &ldquo;Fact is, we're mighty lucky to be living among
      a bunch of city-folks, that recognize artistic things and business-punch
      equally. We'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some Main Street burg
      and tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of life we're used to
      here. But, by golly, there's this you got to say for 'em: Every small
      American town is trying to get population and modern ideals. And darn if a
      lot of 'em don't put it across! Somebody starts panning a rube crossroads,
      telling how he was there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street,
      count 'em, one, and nine hundred human clams. Well, you go back there in
      1920, and you find pavements and a swell little hotel and a first-class
      ladies' ready-to-wear shop&mdash;real perfection, in fact! You don't want to
      just look at what these small towns are, you want to look at what they're
      aiming to become, and they all got an ambition that in the long run is
      going to make 'em the finest spots on earth&mdash;they all want to be just
      like Zenith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      However intimate they might be with T. Cholmondeley Frink as a neighbor,
      as a borrower of lawn-mowers and monkey-wrenches, they knew that he was
      also a Famous Poet and a distinguished advertising-agent; that behind his
      easiness were sultry literary mysteries which they could not penetrate.
      But to-night, in the gin-evolved confidence, he admitted them to the
      arcanum:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a literary problem that's worrying me to death. I'm doing a
      series of ads for the Zeeco Car and I want to make each of 'em a real
      little gem&mdash;reg'lar stylistic stuff. I'm all for this theory that
      perfection is the stunt, or nothing at all, and these are as tough things
      as I ever tackled. You might think it'd be harder to do my poems&mdash;all
      these Heart Topics: home and fireside and happiness&mdash;but they're
      cinches. You can't go wrong on 'em; you know what sentiments any decent
      go-ahead fellow must have if he plays the game, and you stick right to
      'em. But the poetry of industrialism, now there's a literary line where
      you got to open up new territory. Do you know the fellow who's really THE
      American genius? The fellow who you don't know his name and I don't
      either, but his work ought to be preserved so's future generations can
      judge our American thought and originality to-day? Why, the fellow that
      writes the Prince Albert Tobacco ads! Just listen to this:
    </p>
    <p>
      It's P.A. that jams such joy in jimmy pipes. Say&mdash;bet you've often
      bent-an-ear to that spill-of-speech about hopping from five to f-i-f-t-y
      p-e-r by &ldquo;stepping on her a bit!&rdquo; Guess that's going some, all right&mdash;BUT
      just among ourselves, you better start a rapidwhiz system to keep tabs as
      to how fast you'll buzz from low smoke spirits to TIP-TOP-HIGH&mdash;once
      you line up behind a jimmy pipe that's all aglow with that peach-of-a-pal,
      Prince Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Albert is john-on-the-job&mdash;always joy'usly more-ISH in flavor;
      always delightfully cool and fragrant! For a fact, you never hooked such
      double-decked, copper-riveted, two-fisted smoke enjoyment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to a pipe&mdash;speed-o-quick like you light on a good thing! Why&mdash;packed
      with Prince Albert you can play a joy'us jimmy straight across the boards!
      AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that,&rdquo; caroled the motor agent, Eddie Swanson, &ldquo;that's what I call
      he-literature! That Prince Albert fellow&mdash;though, gosh, there can't
      be just one fellow that writes 'em; must be a big board of classy
      ink-slingers in conference, but anyway: now, him, he doesn't write for
      long-haired pikers, he writes for Regular Guys, he writes for ME, and I
      tip my benny to him! The only thing is: I wonder if it sells the goods?
      Course, like all these poets, this Prince Albert fellow lets his idea run
      away with him. It makes elegant reading, but it don't say nothing. I'd
      never go out and buy Prince Albert Tobacco after reading it, because it
      doesn't tell me anything about the stuff. It's just a bunch of fluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frink faced him: &ldquo;Oh, you're crazy! Have I got to sell you the idea of
      Style? Anyway that's the kind of stuff I'd like to do for the Zeeco. But I
      simply can't. So I decided to stick to the straight poetic, and I took a
      shot at a highbrow ad for the Zeeco. How do you like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      The long white trail is calling&mdash;calling&mdash;and it's over the hills and
      far away for every man or woman that has red blood in his veins and on his
      lips the ancient song of the buccaneers. It's away with dull drudging, and
      a fig for care. Speed&mdash;glorious Speed&mdash;it's more than just a
      moment's exhilaration&mdash;it's Life for you and me! This great new truth
      the makers of the Zeeco Car have considered as much as price and style.
      It's fleet as the antelope, smooth as the glide of a swallow, yet powerful
      as the charge of a bull-elephant. Class breathes in every line. Listen,
      brother! You'll never know what the high art of hiking is till you TRY
      LIFE'S ZIPPINGEST ZEST&mdash;THE ZEECO!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Frink mused, &ldquo;that's got an elegant color to it, if I do say so,
      but it ain't got the originality of 'spill-of-speech!'&rdquo; The whole company
      sighed with sympathy and admiration.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      BABBITT was fond of his friends, he loved the importance of being host and
      shouting, &ldquo;Certainly, you're going to have smore chicken&mdash;the idea!&rdquo;
       and he appreciated the genius of T. Cholmondeley Frink, but the vigor of
      the cocktails was gone, and the more he ate the less joyful he felt. Then
      the amity of the dinner was destroyed by the nagging of the Swansons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Floral Heights and the other prosperous sections of Zenith, especially
      in the &ldquo;young married set,&rdquo; there were many women who had nothing to do.
      Though they had few servants, yet with gas stoves, electric ranges and
      dish-washers and vacuum cleaners, and tiled kitchen walls, their houses
      were so convenient that they had little housework, and much of their food
      came from bakeries and delicatessens. They had but two, one, or no
      children; and despite the myth that the Great War had made work
      respectable, their husbands objected to their &ldquo;wasting time and getting a
      lot of crank ideas&rdquo; in unpaid social work, and still more to their causing
      a rumor, by earning money, that they were not adequately supported. They
      worked perhaps two hours a day, and the rest of the time they ate
      chocolates, went to the motion-pictures, went window-shopping, went in
      gossiping twos and threes to card-parties, read magazines, thought
      timorously of the lovers who never appeared, and accumulated a splendid
      restlessness which they got rid of by nagging their husbands. The husbands
      nagged back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these naggers the Swansons were perfect specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the dinner Eddie Swanson had been complaining, publicly, about
      his wife's new frock. It was, he submitted, too short, too low, too
      immodestly thin, and much too expensive. He appealed to Babbitt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, George, what do you think of that rag Louetta went and bought?
      Don't you think it's the limit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's eating you, Eddie? I call it a swell little dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is, Mr. Swanson. It's a sweet frock,&rdquo; Mrs. Babbitt protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, do you see, smarty! You're such an authority on clothes!&rdquo;
       Louetta raged, while the guests ruminated and peeped at her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right now,&rdquo; said Swanson. &ldquo;I'm authority enough so I know it
      was a waste of money, and it makes me tired to see you not wearing out a
      whole closetful of clothes you got already. I've expressed my idea about
      this before, and you know good and well you didn't pay the least bit of
      attention. I have to camp on your trail to get you to do anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much more of it, and they all assisted, all but Babbitt.
      Everything about him was dim except his stomach, and that was a bright
      scarlet disturbance. &ldquo;Had too much grub; oughtn't to eat this stuff,&rdquo; he
      groaned&mdash;while he went on eating, while he gulped down a chill and
      glutinous slice of the ice-cream brick, and cocoanut cake as oozy as
      shaving-cream. He felt as though he had been stuffed with clay; his body
      was bursting, his throat was bursting, his brain was hot mud; and only
      with agony did he continue to smile and shout as became a host on Floral
      Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would, except for his guests, have fled outdoors and walked off the
      intoxication of food, but in the haze which filled the room they sat
      forever, talking, talking, while he agonized, &ldquo;Darn fool to be eating all
      this&mdash;not 'nother mouthful,&rdquo; and discovered that he was again tasting
      the sickly welter of melted ice cream on his plate. There was no magic in
      his friends; he was not uplifted when Howard Littlefield produced from his
      treasure-house of scholarship the information that the chemical symbol for
      raw rubber is C10H16, which turns into isoprene, or 2C5H8. Suddenly,
      without precedent, Babbitt was not merely bored but admitting that he was
      bored. It was ecstasy to escape from the table, from the torture of a
      straight chair, and loll on the davenport in the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others, from their fitful unconvincing talk, their expressions of
      being slowly and painfully smothered, seemed to be suffering from the toil
      of social life and the horror of good food as much as himself. All of them
      accepted with relief the suggestion of bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled. He won at bridge. He
      was again able to endure Vergil Gunch's inexorable heartiness. But he
      pictured loafing with Paul Riesling beside a lake in Maine. It was as
      overpowering and imaginative as homesickness. He had never seen Maine, yet
      he beheld the shrouded mountains, the tranquil lake of evening. &ldquo;That boy
      Paul's worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together,&rdquo; he muttered;
      and, &ldquo;I'd like to get away from&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Louetta Swanson did not rouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Swanson was pretty and pliant. Babbitt was not an analyst of women,
      except as to their tastes in Furnished Houses to Rent. He divided them
      into Real Ladies, Working Women, Old Cranks, and Fly Chickens. He mooned
      over their charms but he was of opinion that all of them (save the women
      of his own family) were &ldquo;different&rdquo; and &ldquo;mysterious.&rdquo; Yet he had known by
      instinct that Louetta Swanson could be approached. Her eyes and lips were
      moist. Her face tapered from a broad forehead to a pointed chin, her mouth
      was thin but strong and avid, and between her brows were two outcurving
      and passionate wrinkles. She was thirty, perhaps, or younger. Gossip had
      never touched her, but every man naturally and instantly rose to
      flirtatiousness when he spoke to her, and every woman watched her with
      stilled blankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between games, sitting on the davenport, Babbitt spoke to her with the
      requisite gallantry, that sonorous Floral Heights gallantry which is not
      flirtation but a terrified flight from it: &ldquo;You're looking like a new
      soda-fountain to night, Louetta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ole Eddie kind of on the rampage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I get so sick of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when you get tired of hubby, you can run off with Uncle George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I ran away&mdash;Oh, well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody ever tell you your hands are awful pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at them, she pulled the lace of her sleeves over them, but
      otherwise she did not heed him. She was lost in unexpressed imaginings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was too languid this evening to pursue his duty of being a
      captivating (though strictly moral) male. He ambled back to the
      bridge-tables. He was not much thrilled when Mrs. Frink, a small
      twittering woman, proposed that they &ldquo;try and do some spiritualism and
      table-tipping&mdash;you know Chum can make the spirits come&mdash;honest,
      he just scares me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies of the party had not emerged all evening, but now, as the sex
      given to things of the spirit while the men warred against base things
      material, they took command and cried, &ldquo;Oh, let's!&rdquo; In the dimness the men
      were rather solemn and foolish, but the goodwives quivered and adored as
      they sat about the table. They laughed, &ldquo;Now, you be good or I'll tell!&rdquo;
       when the men took their hands in the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt tingled with a slight return of interest in life as Louetta
      Swanson's hand closed on his with quiet firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of them hunched over, intent. They startled as some one drew a
      strained breath. In the dusty light from the hall they looked unreal, they
      felt disembodied. Mrs. Gunch squeaked, and they jumped with unnatural
      jocularity, but at Frink's hiss they sank into subdued awe. Suddenly,
      incredibly, they heard a knocking. They stared at Frink's half-revealed
      hands and found them lying still. They wriggled, and pretended not to be
      impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frink spoke with gravity: &ldquo;Is some one there?&rdquo; A thud. &ldquo;Is one knock to be
      the sign for 'yes'?&rdquo; A thud. &ldquo;And two for 'no'?&rdquo; A thud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ladies and gentlemen, shall we ask the guide to put us into
      communication with the spirit of some great one passed over?&rdquo; Frink
      mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Orville Jones begged, &ldquo;Oh, let's talk to Dante! We studied him at the
      Reading Circle. You know who he was, Orvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I know who he was! The Wop poet. Where do you think I was
      raised?&rdquo; from her insulted husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure&mdash;the fellow that took the Cook's Tour to Hell. I've never waded
      through his po'try, but we learned about him in the U.,&rdquo; said Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Page Mr. Dannnnnty!&rdquo; intoned Eddie Swanson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to get him easy, Mr. Frink, you and he being fellow-poets,&rdquo;
       said Louetta Swanson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow-poets, rats! Where d' you get that stuff?&rdquo; protested Vergil Gunch.
      &ldquo;I suppose Dante showed a lot of speed for an old-timer&mdash;not that
      I've actually read him, of course&mdash;but to come right down to hard
      facts, he wouldn't stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to
      practical literature and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every
      day, like Chum does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; from Eddie Swanson. &ldquo;Those old birds could take their time.
      Judas Priest, I could write poetry myself if I had a whole year for it,
      and just wrote about that old-fashioned junk like Dante wrote about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frink demanded, &ldquo;Hush, now! I'll call him. . . O, Laughing Eyes, emerge
      forth into the, uh, the ultimates and bring hither the spirit of Dante,
      that we mortals may list to his words of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgot to give um the address: 1658 Brimstone Avenue, Fiery Heights,
      Hell,&rdquo; Gunch chuckled, but the others felt that this was irreligious. And
      besides&mdash;&ldquo;probably it was just Chum making the knocks, but still, if
      there did happen to be something to all this, be exciting to talk to an
      old fellow belonging to&mdash;way back in early times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thud. The spirit of Dante had come to the parlor of George F. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, it seemed, quite ready to answer their questions. He was &ldquo;glad to
      be with them, this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frink spelled out the messages by running through the alphabet till the
      spirit interpreter knocked at the right letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Littlefield asked, in a learned tone, &ldquo;Do you like it in the Paradiso,
      Messire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very happy on the higher plane, Signor. We are glad that you are
      studying this great truth of spiritualism,&rdquo; Dante replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle moved with an awed creaking of stays and shirt-fronts. &ldquo;Suppose&mdash;suppose
      there were something to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had a different worry. &ldquo;Suppose Chum Frink was really one of these
      spiritualists! Chum had, for a literary fellow, always seemed to be a
      Regular Guy; he belonged to the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church and went
      to the Boosters' lunches and liked cigars and motors and racy stories. But
      suppose that secretly&mdash;After all, you never could tell about these
      darn highbrows; and to be an out-and-out spiritualist would be almost like
      being a socialist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could long be serious in the presence of Vergil Gunch. &ldquo;Ask Dant'
      how Jack Shakespeare and old Verg'&mdash;the guy they named after me&mdash;are
      gettin' along, and don't they wish they could get into the movie game!&rdquo; he
      blared, and instantly all was mirth. Mrs. Jones shrieked, and Eddie
      Swanson desired to know whether Dante didn't catch cold with nothing on
      but his wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleased Dante made humble answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Babbitt&mdash;the curst discontent was torturing him again, and
      heavily, in the impersonal darkness, he pondered, &ldquo;I don't&mdash;We're all
      so flip and think we're so smart. There'd be&mdash;A fellow like Dante&mdash;I
      wish I'd read some of his pieces. I don't suppose I ever will, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had, without explanation, the impression of a slaggy cliff and on it,
      in silhouette against menacing clouds, a lone and austere figure. He was
      dismayed by a sudden contempt for his surest friends. He grasped Louetta
      Swanson's hand, and found the comfort of human warmth. Habit came, a
      veteran warrior; and he shook himself. &ldquo;What the deuce is the matter with
      me, this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted Louetta's hand, to indicate that he hadn't meant anything
      improper by squeezing it, and demanded of Frink, &ldquo;Say, see if you can get
      old Dant' to spiel us some of his poetry. Talk up to him. Tell him, 'Buena
      giorna, senor, com sa va, wie geht's? Keskersaykersa a little pome,
      senor?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights were switched on; the women sat on the fronts of their chairs
      in that determined suspense whereby a wife indicates that as soon as the
      present speaker has finished, she is going to remark brightly to her
      husband, &ldquo;Well, dear, I think per-HAPS it's about time for us to be saying
      good-night.&rdquo; For once Babbitt did not break out in blustering efforts to
      keep the party going. He had&mdash;there was something he wished to think
      out&mdash;But the psychical research had started them off again. (&ldquo;Why
      didn't they go home! Why didn't they go home!&rdquo;) Though he was impressed by
      the profundity of the statement, he was only half-enthusiastic when Howard
      Littlefield lectured, &ldquo;The United States is the only nation in which the
      government is a Moral Ideal and not just a social arrangement.&rdquo; (&ldquo;True&mdash;true&mdash;weren't
      they EVER going home?&rdquo;) He was usually delighted to have an &ldquo;inside view&rdquo;
       of the momentous world of motors but to-night he scarcely listened to
      Eddie Swanson's revelation: &ldquo;If you want to go above the Javelin class,
      the Zeeco is a mighty good buy. Couple weeks ago, and mind you, this was a
      fair, square test, they took a Zeeco stock touring-car and they slid up
      the Tonawanda hill on high, and fellow told me&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Zeeco good boat
      but&mdash;Were they planning to stay all night?&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      They really were going, with a flutter of &ldquo;We did have the best time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most aggressively friendly of all was Babbitt, yet as he burbled he was
      reflecting, &ldquo;I got through it, but for a while there I didn't hardly think
      I'd last out.&rdquo; He prepared to taste that most delicate pleasure of the
      host: making fun of his guests in the relaxation of midnight. As the door
      closed he yawned voluptuously, chest out, shoulders wriggling, and turned
      cynically to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beaming. &ldquo;Oh, it was nice, wasn't it! I know they enjoyed every
      minute of it. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He couldn't do it. He couldn't mock. It would have been like sneering at a
      happy child. He lied ponderously: &ldquo;You bet! Best party this year, by a
      long shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't the dinner good! And honestly I thought the fried chicken was
      delicious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! Fried to the Queen's taste. Best fried chicken I've tasted for a
      coon's age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Matilda fry it beautifully! And don't you think the soup was
      simply delicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly was! It was corking! Best soup I've tasted since Heck was a
      pup!&rdquo; But his voice was seeping away. They stood in the hall, under the
      electric light in its square box-like shade of red glass bound with
      nickel. She stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George, you don't sound&mdash;you sound as if you hadn't really
      enjoyed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I did! Course I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm kind of tired, I guess. Been pounding pretty hard at the office.
      Need to get away and rest up a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we're going to Maine in just a few weeks now, dear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yuh&mdash;&rdquo;
       Then he was pouring it out nakedly, robbed of reticence. &ldquo;Myra: I think
      it'd be a good thing for me to get up there early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have this man you have to meet in New York about business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man? Oh, sure. Him. Oh, that's all off. But I want to hit Maine
      early&mdash;get in a little fishing, catch me a big trout, by golly!&rdquo; A
      nervous, artificial laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't we do it? Verona and Matilda can run the house between
      them, and you and I can go any time, if you think we can afford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's&mdash;I've been feeling so jumpy lately, I thought maybe it
      might be a good thing if I kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! Don't you WANT me to go along?&rdquo; She was too wretchedly in earnest
      to be tragic, or gloriously insulted, or anything save dumpy and
      defenseless and flushed to the red steaminess of a boiled beet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do! I just meant&mdash;&rdquo; Remembering that Paul Riesling had
      predicted this, he was as desperate as she. &ldquo;I mean, sometimes it's a good
      thing for an old grouch like me to go off and get it out of his system.&rdquo;
       He tried to sound paternal. &ldquo;Then when you and the kids arrive&mdash;I
      figured maybe I might skip up to Maine just a few days ahead of you&mdash;I'd
      be ready for a real bat, see how I mean?&rdquo; He coaxed her with large booming
      sounds, with affable smiles, like a popular preacher blessing an Easter
      congregation, like a humorous lecturer completing his stint of eloquence,
      like all perpetrators of masculine wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him, the joy of festival drained from her face. &ldquo;Do I bother
      you when we go on vacations? Don't I add anything to your fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke. Suddenly, dreadfully, he was hysterical, he was a yelping baby.
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes! Hell, yes! But can't you understand I'm shot to pieces?
      I'm all in! I got to take care of myself! I tell you, I got to&mdash;I'm
      sick of everything and everybody! I got to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was she who was mature and protective now. &ldquo;Why, of course! You shall
      run off by yourself! Why don't you get Paul to go along, and you boys just
      fish and have a good time?&rdquo; She patted his shoulder&mdash;reaching up to
      it&mdash;while he shook with palsied helplessness, and in that moment was
      not merely by habit fond of her but clung to her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cried cheerily, &ldquo;Now up-stairs you go, and pop into bed. We'll fix it
      all up. I'll see to the doors. Now skip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For many minutes, for many hours, for a bleak eternity, he lay awake,
      shivering, reduced to primitive terror, comprehending that he had won
      freedom, and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so
      embarrassing as freedom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      No apartment-house in Zenith had more resolutely experimented in
      condensation than the Revelstoke Arms, in which Paul and Zilla Riesling
      had a flat. By sliding the beds into low closets the bedrooms were
      converted into living-rooms. The kitchens were cupboards each containing
      an electric range, a copper sink, a glass refrigerator, and, very
      intermittently, a Balkan maid. Everything about the Arms was excessively
      modern, and everything was compressed&mdash;except the garages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Babbitts were calling on the Rieslings at the Arms. It was a
      speculative venture to call on the Rieslings; interesting and sometimes
      disconcerting. Zilla was an active, strident, full-blown, high-bosomed
      blonde. When she condescended to be good-humored she was nervously
      amusing. Her comments on people were saltily satiric and penetrative of
      accepted hypocrisies. &ldquo;That's so!&rdquo; you said, and looked sheepish. She
      danced wildly, and called on the world to be merry, but in the midst of it
      she would turn indignant. She was always becoming indignant. Life was a
      plot against her and she exposed it furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was affable to-night. She merely hinted that Orville Jones wore a
      toupe, that Mrs. T. Cholmondeley Frink's singing resembled a Ford going
      into high, and that the Hon. Otis Deeble, mayor of Zenith and candidate
      for Congress, was a flatulent fool (which was quite true). The Babbitts
      and Rieslings sat doubtfully on stone-hard brocade chairs in the small
      living-room of the flat, with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace, and
      its strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new player-piano, till Mrs.
      Riesling shrieked, &ldquo;Come on! Let's put some pep in it! Get out your
      fiddle, Paul, and I'll try to make Georgie dance decently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Babbitts were in earnest. They were plotting for the escape to Maine.
      But when Mrs. Babbitt hinted with plump smilingness, &ldquo;Does Paul get as
      tired after the winter's work as Georgie does?&rdquo; then Zilla remembered an
      injury; and when Zilla Riesling remembered an injury the world stopped
      till something had been done about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he get tired? No, he doesn't get tired, he just goes crazy, that's
      all! You think Paul is so reasonable, oh, yes, and he loves to make out
      he's a little lamb, but he's stubborn as a mule. Oh, if you had to live
      with him&mdash;! You'd find out how sweet he is! He just pretends to be
      meek so he can have his own way. And me, I get the credit for being a
      terrible old crank, but if I didn't blow up once in a while and get
      something started, we'd die of dry-rot. He never wants to go any place and&mdash;Why,
      last evening, just because the car was out of order&mdash;and that was his
      fault, too, because he ought to have taken it to the service-station and
      had the battery looked at&mdash;and he didn't want to go down to the
      movies on the trolley. But we went, and then there was one of those
      impudent conductors, and Paul wouldn't do a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was standing on the platform waiting for the people to let me into the
      car, and this beast, this conductor, hollered at me, 'Come on, you, move
      up!' Why, I've never had anybody speak to me that way in all my life! I
      was so astonished I just turned to him and said&mdash;I thought there must
      be some mistake, and so I said to him, perfectly pleasant, 'Were you
      speaking to me?' and he went on and bellowed at me, 'Yes, I was! You're
      keeping the whole car from starting!' he said, and then I saw he was one
      of these dirty ill-bred hogs that kindness is wasted on, and so I stopped
      and looked right at him, and I said, 'I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon,
      I am not doing anything of the kind,' I said, 'it's the people ahead of
      me, who won't move up,' I said, 'and furthermore, let me tell you, young
      man, that you're a low-down, foul-mouthed, impertinent skunk,' I said,
      'and you're no gentleman! I certainly intend to report you, and we'll
      see,' I said, 'whether a lady is to be insulted by any drunken bum that
      chooses to put on a ragged uniform, and I'd thank you,' I said, 'to keep
      your filthy abuse to yourself.' And then I waited for Paul to show he was
      half a man and come to my defense, and he just stood there and pretended
      he hadn't heard a word, and so I said to him, 'Well,' I said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cut it, cut it, Zill!&rdquo; Paul groaned. &ldquo;We all know I'm a mollycoddle,
      and you're a tender bud, and let's let it go at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it go?&rdquo; Zilla's face was wrinkled like the Medusa, her voice was a
      dagger of corroded brass. She was full of the joy of righteousness and bad
      temper. She was a crusader and, like every crusader, she exulted in the
      opportunity to be vicious in the name of virtue. &ldquo;Let it go? If people
      knew how many things I've let go&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quit being such a bully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a fine figure you'd cut if I didn't bully you! You'd lie abed till
      noon and play your idiotic fiddle till midnight! You're born lazy, and
      you're born shiftless, and you're born cowardly, Paul Riesling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now, don't say that, Zilla; you don't mean a word of it!&rdquo; protested
      Mrs. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say that, and I mean every single last word of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now, Zilla, the idea!&rdquo; Mrs. Babbitt was maternal and fussy. She was
      no older than Zilla, but she seemed so&mdash;at first. She was placid and
      puffy and mature, where Zilla, at forty-five, was so bleached and
      tight-corseted that you knew only that she was older than she looked. &ldquo;The
      idea of talking to poor Paul like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Paul is right! We'd both be poor, we'd be in the poorhouse, if I
      didn't jazz him up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now, Zilla, Georgie and I were just saying how hard Paul's been
      working all year, and we were thinking it would be lovely if the Boys
      could run off by themselves. I've been coaxing George to go up to Maine
      ahead of the rest of us, and get the tired out of his system before we
      come, and I think it would be lovely if Paul could manage to get away and
      join him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this exposure of his plot to escape, Paul was startled out of
      impassivity. He rubbed his fingers. His hands twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zilla bayed, &ldquo;Yes! You're lucky! You can let George go, and not have to
      watch him. Fat old Georgie! Never peeps at another woman! Hasn't got the
      spunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell I haven't!&rdquo; Babbitt was fervently defending his priceless
      immorality when Paul interrupted him&mdash;and Paul looked dangerous. He
      rose quickly; he said gently to Zilla:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you imply I have a lot of sweethearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my dear, since you ask for it&mdash;There hasn't been a time
      in the last ten years when I haven't found some nice little girl to
      comfort me, and as long as you continue your amiability I shall probably
      continue to deceive you. It isn't hard. You're so stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zilla gibbered; she howled; words could not be distinguished in her slaver
      of abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the bland George F. Babbitt was transformed. If Paul was dangerous,
      if Zilla was a snake-locked fury, if the neat emotions suitable to the
      Revelstoke Arms had been slashed into raw hatreds, it was Babbitt who was
      the most formidable. He leaped up. He seemed very large. He seized Zilla's
      shoulder. The cautions of the broker were wiped from his face, and his
      voice was cruel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had enough of all this damn nonsense! I've known you for twenty-five
      years, Zil, and I never knew you to miss a chance to take your
      disappointments out on Paul. You're not wicked. You're worse. You're a
      fool. And let me tell you that Paul is the finest boy God ever made. Every
      decent person is sick and tired of your taking advantage of being a woman
      and springing every mean innuendo you can think of. Who the hell are you
      that a person like Paul should have to ask your PERMISSION to go with me?
      You act like you were a combination of Queen Victoria and Cleopatra. You
      fool, can't you see how people snicker at you, and sneer at you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zilla was sobbing, &ldquo;I've never&mdash;I've never&mdash;nobody ever talked
      to me like this in all my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but that's the way they talk behind your back! Always! They say
      you're a scolding old woman. Old, by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That cowardly attack broke her. Her eyes were blank. She wept. But Babbitt
      glared stolidly. He felt that he was the all-powerful official in charge;
      that Paul and Mrs. Babbitt looked on him with awe; that he alone could
      handle this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zilla writhed. She begged, &ldquo;Oh, they don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They certainly do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been a bad woman! I'm terribly sorry! I'll kill myself! I'll do
      anything. Oh, I'll&mdash;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She abased herself completely. Also, she enjoyed it. To the connoisseur of
      scenes, nothing is more enjoyable than a thorough, melodramatic, egoistic
      humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to let Paul beat it off to Maine with me,&rdquo; Babbitt demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help his going? You've just said I was an idiot and nobody paid
      any attention to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can help it, all right, all right! What you got to do is to cut
      out hinting that the minute he gets out of your sight, he'll go chasing
      after some petticoat. Matter fact, that's the way you start the boy off
      wrong. You ought to have more sense&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will, honestly, I will, George. I know I was bad. Oh, forgive me,
      all of you, forgive me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did Babbitt. He condemned magnificently and forgave piously, and as he
      went parading out with his wife he was grandly explanatory to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of a shame to bully Zilla, but course it was the only way to handle
      her. Gosh, I certainly did have her crawling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said calmly, &ldquo;Yes. You were horrid. You were showing off. You were
      having a lovely time thinking what a great fine person you were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by golly! Can you beat it! Of course I might of expected you to not
      stand by me! I might of expected you'd stick up for your own sex!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Poor Zilla, she's so unhappy. She takes it out on Paul. She hasn't a
      single thing to do, in that little flat. And she broods too much. And she
      used to be so pretty and gay, and she resents losing it. And you were just
      as nasty and mean as you could be. I'm not a bit proud of you&mdash;or of
      Paul, boasting about his horrid love-affairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sulkily silent; he maintained his bad temper at a high level of
      outraged nobility all the four blocks home. At the door he left her, in
      self-approving haughtiness, and tramped the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shock it was revealed to him: &ldquo;Gosh, I wonder if she was right&mdash;if
      she was partly right?&rdquo; Overwork must have flayed him to abnormal
      sensitiveness; it was one of the few times in his life when he had queried
      his eternal excellence; and he perceived the summer night, smelled the wet
      grass. Then: &ldquo;I don't care! I've pulled it off. We're going to have our
      spree. And for Paul, I'd do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      They were buying their Maine tackle at Ijams Brothers', the Sporting Goods
      Mart, with the help of Willis Ijams, fellow member of the Boosters' Club.
      Babbitt was completely mad. He trumpeted and danced. He muttered to Paul,
      &ldquo;Say, this is pretty good, eh? To be buying the stuff, eh? And good old
      Willis Ijams himself coming down on the floor to wait on us! Say, if those
      fellows that are getting their kit for the North Lakes knew we were going
      clear up to Maine, they'd have a fit, eh? . . . Well, come on, Brother
      Ijams&mdash;Willis, I mean. Here's your chance! We're a couple of easy
      marks! Whee! Let me at it! I'm going to buy out the store!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gloated on fly-rods and gorgeous rubber hip-boots, on tents with
      celluloid windows and folding chairs and ice-boxes. He simple-heartedly
      wanted to buy all of them. It was the Paul whom he was always vaguely
      protecting who kept him from his drunken desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even Paul lightened when Willis Ijams, a salesman with poetry and
      diplomacy, discussed flies. &ldquo;Now, of course, you boys know.&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      great scrap is between dry flies and wet flies. Personally, I'm for dry
      flies. More sporting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. Lots more sporting,&rdquo; fulminated Babbitt, who knew very little
      about flies either wet or dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if you'll take my advice, Georgie, you'll stock up well on these pale
      evening dims, and silver sedges, and red ants. Oh, boy, there's a fly,
      that red ant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! That's what it is&mdash;a fly!&rdquo; rejoiced Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, that red ant,&rdquo; said Ijams, &ldquo;is a real honest-to-God FLY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess ole Mr. Trout won't come a-hustling when I drop one of those
      red ants on the water!&rdquo; asserted Babbitt, and his thick wrists made a
      rapturous motion of casting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the landlocked salmon will take it, too,&rdquo; said Ijams, who had
      never seen a landlocked salmon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salmon! Trout! Say, Paul, can you see Uncle George with his khaki pants
      on haulin' 'em in, some morning 'bout seven? Whee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on the New York express, incredibly bound for Maine, incredibly
      without their families. They were free, in a man's world, in the
      smoking-compartment of the Pullman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the car window was a glaze of darkness stippled with the gold of
      infrequent mysterious lights. Babbitt was immensely conscious, in the sway
      and authoritative clatter of the train, of going, of going on. Leaning
      toward Paul he grunted, &ldquo;Gosh, pretty nice to be hiking, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small room, with its walls of ocher-colored steel, was filled mostly
      with the sort of men he classified as the Best Fellows You'll Ever Meet&mdash;Real
      Good Mixers. There were four of them on the long seat; a fat man with a
      shrewd fat face, a knife-edged man in a green velour hat, a very young
      young man with an imitation amber cigarette-holder, and Babbitt. Facing
      them, on two movable leather chairs, were Paul and a lanky, old-fashioned
      man, very cunning, with wrinkles bracketing his mouth. They all read
      newspapers or trade journals, boot-and-shoe journals, crockery journals,
      and waited for the joys of conversation. It was the very young man, now
      making his first journey by Pullman, who began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, gee, I had a wild old time in Zenith!&rdquo; he gloried. &ldquo;Say, if a fellow
      knows the ropes there he can have as wild a time as he can in New York!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, I bet you simply raised the old Ned. I figured you were a bad man
      when I saw you get on the train!&rdquo; chuckled the fat one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others delightedly laid down their papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all right now! I guess I seen some things in the Arbor you
      never seen!&rdquo; complained the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll bet you did! I bet you lapped up the malted milk like a reg'lar
      little devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, the boy having served as introduction, they ignored him and charged
      into real talk. Only Paul, sitting by himself, reading at a serial story
      in a newspaper, failed to join them and all but Babbitt regarded him as a
      snob, an eccentric, a person of no spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which of them said which has never been determined, and does not matter,
      since they all had the same ideas and expressed them always with the same
      ponderous and brassy assurance. If it was not Babbitt who was delivering
      any given verdict, at least he was beaming on the chancellor who did
      deliver it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that, though,&rdquo; announced the first &ldquo;they're selling quite some booze
      in Zenith. Guess they are everywhere. I don't know how you fellows feel
      about prohibition, but the way it strikes me is that it's a mighty
      beneficial thing for the poor zob that hasn't got any will-power but for
      fellows like us, it's an infringement of personal liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact. Congress has got no right to interfere with a fellow's
      personal liberty,&rdquo; contended the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man came in from the car, but as all the seats were full he stood up
      while he smoked his cigarette. He was an Outsider; he was not one of the
      Old Families of the smoking-compartment. They looked upon him bleakly and,
      after trying to appear at ease by examining his chin in the mirror, he
      gave it up and went out in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just been making a trip through the South. Business conditions not very
      good down there,&rdquo; said one of the council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a fact! Not very good, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, didn't strike me they were up to normal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not up to normal, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn't hardly say they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole council nodded sagely and decided, &ldquo;Yump, not hardly up to
      snuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, business conditions ain't what they ought to be out West, neither,
      not by a long shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact. And I guess the hotel business feels it. That's one good
      thing, though: these hotels that've been charging five bucks a day&mdash;yes,
      and maybe six&mdash;seven!&mdash;for a rotten room are going to be darn
      glad to get four, and maybe give you a little service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact. Say, uh, speaknubout hotels, I hit the St. Francis at San
      Francisco for the first time, the other day, and, say, it certainly is a
      first-class place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, brother! The St. Francis is a swell place&mdash;absolutely
      A1.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact. I'm right with you. It's a first-class place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, but say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago?
      I don't want to knock&mdash;I believe in boosting wherever you can&mdash;but
      say, of all the rotten dumps that pass 'emselves off as first-class
      hotels, that's the worst. I'm going to get those guys, one of these days,
      and I told 'em so. You know how I am&mdash;well, maybe you don't know, but
      I'm accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I'm perfectly willing to
      pay a reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the other night, and the
      Rippleton's near the station&mdash;I'd never been there before, but I says
      to the taxi-driver&mdash;I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in
      late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it's worth it when you got
      to be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs&mdash;and I
      said to him, 'Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we got there, and I breezed up to the desk and said to the clerk,
      'Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?' Saaaay! You'd
      'a' thought I'd sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! He
      hands me the cold-boiled stare and yaps, 'I dunno, friend, I'll see,' and
      he ducks behind the rigamajig they keep track of the rooms on. Well, I
      guess he called up the Credit Association and the American Security League
      to see if I was all right&mdash;he certainly took long enough&mdash;or
      maybe he just went to sleep; but finally he comes out and looks at me like
      it hurts him, and croaks, 'I think I can let you have a room with bath.'
      'Well, that's awful nice of you&mdash;sorry to trouble you&mdash;how much
      'll it set me back?' I says, real sweet. 'It'll cost you seven bucks a
      day, friend,' he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was late, and anyway, it went down on my expense-account&mdash;gosh,
      if I'd been paying it instead of the firm, I'd 'a' tramped the streets all
      night before I'd 'a' let any hick tavern stick me seven great big round
      dollars, believe me! So I lets it go at that. Well, the clerk wakes a nice
      young bell hop&mdash;fine lad&mdash;not a day over seventy-nine years old&mdash;fought
      at the Battle of Gettysburg and doesn't know it's over yet&mdash;thought I
      was one of the Confederates, I guess, from the way he looked at me&mdash;and
      Rip van Winkle took me up to something&mdash;I found out afterwards they
      called it a room, but first I thought there'd been some mistake&mdash;I
      thought they were putting me in the Salvation Army collection-box! At
      seven per each and every diem! Gosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, I've heard the Rippleton was pretty cheesy. Now, when I go to
      Chicago I always stay at the Blackstone or the La Salle&mdash;first-class
      places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Birchdale at Terre Haute? How is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Birchdale is a first-class hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Twelve minutes of conference on the state of hotels in South Bend, Flint,
      Dayton, Tulsa, Wichita, Fort Worth, Winona, Erie, Fargo, and Moose Jaw.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaknubout prices,&rdquo; the man in the velour hat observed, fingering the
      elk-tooth on his heavy watch-chain, &ldquo;I'd like to know where they get this
      stuff about clothes coming down. Now, you take this suit I got on.&rdquo; He
      pinched his trousers-leg. &ldquo;Four years ago I paid forty-two fifty for it,
      and it was real sure-'nough value. Well, here the other day I went into a
      store back home and asked to see a suit, and the fellow yanks out some
      hand-me-downs that, honest, I wouldn't put on a hired man. Just out of
      curiosity I asks him, 'What you charging for that junk?' 'Junk,' he says,
      'what d' you mean junk? That's a swell piece of goods, all wool&mdash;'
      Like hell! It was nice vegetable wool, right off the Ole Plantation! 'It's
      all wool,' he says, 'and we get sixty-seven ninety for it.' 'Oh, you do,
      do you!' I says. 'Not from me you don't,' I says, and I walks right out on
      him. You bet! I says to the wife, 'Well,' I said, 'as long as your
      strength holds out and you can go on putting a few more patches on papa's
      pants, we'll just pass up buying clothes.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, brother. And just look at collars, frinstance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Wait!&rdquo; the fat man protested. &ldquo;What's the matter with collars? I'm
      selling collars! D' you realize the cost of labor on collars is still two
      hundred and seven per cent. above&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They voted that if their old friend the fat man sold collars, then the
      price of collars was exactly what it should be; but all other clothing was
      tragically too expensive. They admired and loved one another now. They
      went profoundly into the science of business, and indicated that the
      purpose of manufacturing a plow or a brick was so that it might be sold.
      To them, the Romantic Hero was no longer the knight, the wandering poet,
      the cowpuncher, the aviator, nor the brave young district attorney, but
      the great sales-manager, who had an Analysis of Merchandizing Problems on
      his glass-topped desk, whose title of nobility was &ldquo;Go-getter,&rdquo; and who
      devoted himself and all his young samurai to the cosmic purpose of Selling&mdash;not
      of selling anything in particular, for or to anybody in particular, but
      pure Selling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop-talk roused Paul Riesling. Though he was a player of violins and
      an interestingly unhappy husband, he was also a very able salesman of
      tar-roofing. He listened to the fat man's remarks on &ldquo;the value of
      house-organs and bulletins as a method of jazzing-up the Boys out on the
      road;&rdquo; and he himself offered one or two excellent thoughts on the use of
      two-cent stamps on circulars. Then he committed an offense against the
      holy law of the Clan of Good Fellows. He became highbrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were entering a city. On the outskirts they passed a steel-mill which
      flared in scarlet and orange flame that licked at the cadaverous stacks,
      at the iron-sheathed walls and sullen converters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord, look at that&mdash;beautiful!&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it's beautiful, friend. That's the Shelling-Horton Steel Plant,
      and they tell me old John Shelling made a good three million bones out of
      munitions during the war!&rdquo; the man with the velour hat said reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;I mean it's lovely the way the light pulls that
      picturesque yard, all littered with junk, right out of the darkness,&rdquo; said
      Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stared at him, while Babbitt crowed, &ldquo;Paul there has certainly got
      one great little eye for picturesque places and quaint sights and all that
      stuff. 'D of been an author or something if he hadn't gone into the
      roofing line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul looked annoyed. (Babbitt sometimes wondered if Paul appreciated his
      loyal boosting.) The man in the velour hat grunted, &ldquo;Well, personally, I
      think Shelling-Horton keep their works awful dirty. Bum routing. But I
      don't suppose there's any law against calling 'em 'picturesque' if it gets
      you that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul sulkily returned to his newspaper and the conversation logically
      moved on to trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time do we get into Pittsburg?&rdquo; asked Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pittsburg? I think we get in at&mdash;no, that was last year's schedule&mdash;wait
      a minute&mdash;let's see&mdash;got a time-table right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we're on time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, sure, we must be just about on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we aren't&mdash;we were seven minutes late, last station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were we? Straight? Why, gosh, I thought we were right on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we're about seven minutes late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, that's right; seven minutes late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter entered&mdash;a negro in white jacket with brass buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How late are we, George?&rdquo; growled the fat man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed, I don't know, sir. I think we're about on time,&rdquo; said the porter,
      folding towels and deftly tossing them up on the rack above the washbowls.
      The council stared at him gloomily and when he was gone they wailed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what's come over these niggers, nowadays. They never give
      you a civil answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact. They're getting so they don't have a single bit of respect
      for you. The old-fashioned coon was a fine old cuss&mdash;he knew his
      place&mdash;but these young dinges don't want to be porters or
      cotton-pickers. Oh, no! They got to be lawyers and professors and Lord
      knows what all! I tell you, it's becoming a pretty serious problem. We
      ought to get together and show the black man, yes, and the yellow man, his
      place. Now, I haven't got one particle of race-prejudice. I'm the first to
      be glad when a nigger succeeds&mdash;so long as he stays where he belongs
      and doesn't try to usurp the rightful authority and business ability of
      the white man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the i.! And another thing we got to do,&rdquo; said the man with the
      velour hat (whose name was Koplinsky), &ldquo;is to keep these damn foreigners
      out of the country. Thank the Lord, we're putting a limit on immigration.
      These Dagoes and Hunkies have got to learn that this is a white man's
      country, and they ain't wanted here. When we've assimilated the foreigners
      we got here now and learned 'em the principles of Americanism and turned
      'em into regular folks, why then maybe we'll let in a few more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet. That's a fact,&rdquo; they observed, and passed on to lighter topics.
      They rapidly reviewed motor-car prices, tire-mileage, oil-stocks, fishing,
      and the prospects for the wheat-crop in Dakota.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fat man was impatient at this waste of time. He was a veteran
      traveler and free of illusions. Already he had asserted that he was &ldquo;an
      old he-one.&rdquo; He leaned forward, gathered in their attention by his
      expression of sly humor, and grumbled, &ldquo;Oh, hell, boys, let's cut out the
      formality and get down to the stories!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They became very lively and intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul and the boy vanished. The others slid forward on the long seat,
      unbuttoned their vests, thrust their feet up on the chairs, pulled the
      stately brass cuspidors nearer, and ran the green window-shade down on its
      little trolley, to shut them in from the uncomfortable strangeness of
      night. After each bark of laughter they cried, &ldquo;Say, jever hear the one
      about&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt was expansive and virile. When the train stopped at
      an important station, the four men walked up and down the cement platform,
      under the vast smoky train-shed roof, like a stormy sky, under the
      elevated footways, beside crates of ducks and sides of beef, in the
      mystery of an unknown city. They strolled abreast, old friends and well
      content. At the long-drawn &ldquo;Alllll aboarrrrrd&rdquo;&mdash;like a mountain call
      at dusk&mdash;they hastened back into the smoking-compartment, and till
      two of the morning continued the droll tales, their eyes damp with
      cigar-smoke and laughter. When they parted they shook hands, and chuckled,
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it's been a great session. Sorry to bust it up. Mighty glad to
      met you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt lay awake in the close hot tomb of his Pullman berth, shaking with
      remembrance of the fat man's limerick about the lady who wished to be
      wild. He raised the shade; he lay with a puffy arm tucked between his head
      and the skimpy pillow, looking out on the sliding silhouettes of trees,
      and village lamps like exclamation-points. He was very happy.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THEY had four hours in New York between trains. The one thing Babbitt
      wished to see was the Pennsylvania Hotel, which had been built since his
      last visit. He stared up at it, muttering, &ldquo;Twenty-two hundred rooms and
      twenty-two hundred baths! That's got everything in the world beat. Lord,
      their turnover must be&mdash;well, suppose price of rooms is four to eight
      dollars a day, and I suppose maybe some ten and&mdash;four times
      twenty-two hundred-say six times twenty-two hundred&mdash;well, anyway,
      with restaurants and everything, say summers between eight and fifteen
      thousand a day. Every day! I never thought I'd see a thing like that! Some
      town! Of course the average fellow in Zenith has got more Individual
      Initiative than the fourflushers here, but I got to hand it to New York.
      Yes, sir, town, you're all right&mdash;some ways. Well, old Paulski, I
      guess we've seen everything that's worth while. How'll we kill the rest of
      the time? Movie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Paul desired to see a liner. &ldquo;Always wanted to go to Europe&mdash;and,
      by thunder, I will, too, some day before I past out,&rdquo; he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a rough wharf on the North River they stared at the stern of the
      Aquitania and her stacks and wireless antenna lifted above the dock-house
      which shut her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By golly,&rdquo; Babbitt droned, &ldquo;wouldn't be so bad to go over to the Old
      Country and take a squint at all these ruins, and the place where
      Shakespeare was born. And think of being able to order a drink whenever
      you wanted one! Just range up to a bar and holler out loud, 'Gimme a
      cocktail, and darn the police!' Not bad at all. What juh like to see, over
      there, Paulibus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul did not answer. Babbitt turned. Paul was standing with clenched
      fists, head drooping, staring at the liner as in terror. His thin body,
      seen against the summer-glaring planks of the wharf, was childishly
      meager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, &ldquo;What would you hit for on the other side, Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scowling at the steamer, his breast heaving, Paul whispered, &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;
       While Babbitt watched him anxiously he snapped, &ldquo;Come on, let's get out of
      this,&rdquo; and hastened down the wharf, not looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's funny,&rdquo; considered Babbitt. &ldquo;The boy didn't care for seeing the
      ocean boats after all. I thought he'd be interested in 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he exulted, and made sage speculations about locomotive
      horse-power, as their train climbed the Maine mountain-ridge and from the
      summit he looked down the shining way among the pines; though he remarked,
      &ldquo;Well, by golly!&rdquo; when he discovered that the station at Katadumcook, the
      end of the line, was an aged freight-car; Babbitt's moment of impassioned
      release came when they sat on a tiny wharf on Lake Sunasquam, awaiting the
      launch from the hotel. A raft had floated down the lake; between the logs
      and the shore, the water was transparent, thin-looking, flashing with
      minnows. A guide in black felt hat with trout-flies in the band, and
      flannel shirt of a peculiarly daring blue, sat on a log and whittled and
      was silent. A dog, a good country dog, black and woolly gray, a dog rich
      in leisure and in meditation, scratched and grunted and slept. The thick
      sunlight was lavish on the bright water, on the rim of gold-green balsam
      boughs, the silver birches and tropic ferns, and across the lake it burned
      on the sturdy shoulders of the mountains. Over everything was a holy
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent, they loafed on the edge of the wharf, swinging their legs above
      the water. The immense tenderness of the place sank into Babbitt, and he
      murmured, &ldquo;I'd just like to sit here&mdash;the rest of my life&mdash;and
      whittle&mdash;and sit. And never hear a typewriter. Or Stan Graff fussing
      in the 'phone. Or Rone and Ted scrapping. Just sit. Gosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted Paul's shoulder. &ldquo;How does it strike you, old snoozer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's darn good, Georgie. There's something sort of eternal about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once, Babbitt understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Their launch rounded the bend; at the head of the lake, under a mountain
      slope, they saw the little central dining-shack of their hotel and the
      crescent of squat log cottages which served as bedrooms. They landed, and
      endured the critical examination of the habitues who had been at the hotel
      for a whole week. In their cottage, with its high stone fireplace, they
      hastened, as Babbitt expressed it, to &ldquo;get into some regular he-togs.&rdquo;
       They came out; Paul in an old gray suit and soft white shirt; Babbitt in
      khaki shirt and vast and flapping khaki trousers. It was excessively new
      khaki; his rimless spectacles belonged to a city office; and his face was
      not tanned but a city pink. He made a discordant noise in the place. But
      with infinite satisfaction he slapped his legs and crowed, &ldquo;Say, this is
      getting back home, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood on the wharf before the hotel. He winked at Paul and drew from
      his back pocket a plug of chewing-tobacco, a vulgarism forbidden in the
      Babbitt home. He took a chew, beaming and wagging his head as he tugged at
      it. &ldquo;Um! Um! Maybe I haven't been hungry for a wad of eating-tobacco! Have
      some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other in a grin of understanding. Paul took the plug,
      gnawed at it. They stood quiet, their jaws working. They solemnly spat,
      one after the other, into the placid water. They stretched voluptuously,
      with lifted arms and arched backs. From beyond the mountains came the
      shuffling sound of a far-off train. A trout leaped, and fell back in a
      silver circle. They sighed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a week before their families came. Each evening they planned to
      get up early and fish before breakfast. Each morning they lay abed till
      the breakfast-bell, pleasantly conscious that there were no efficient
      wives to rouse them. The mornings were cold; the fire was kindly as they
      dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul was distressingly clean, but Babbitt reveled in a good sound
      dirtiness, in not having to shave till his spirit was moved to it. He
      treasured every grease spot and fish-scale on his new khaki trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All morning they fished unenergetically, or tramped the dim and
      aqueous-lighted trails among rank ferns and moss sprinkled with crimson
      bells. They slept all afternoon, and till midnight played stud-poker with
      the guides. Poker was a serious business to the guides. They did not
      gossip; they shuffled the thick greasy cards with a deft ferocity menacing
      to the &ldquo;sports;&rdquo; and Joe Paradise, king of guides, was sarcastic to
      loiterers who halted the game even to scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, as Paul and he blundered to their cottage over the pungent
      wet grass, and pine-roots confusing in the darkness, Babbitt rejoiced that
      he did not have to explain to his wife where he had been all evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not talk much. The nervous loquacity and opinionation of the
      Zenith Athletic Club dropped from them. But when they did talk they
      slipped into the naive intimacy of college days. Once they drew their
      canoe up to the bank of Sunasquam Water, a stream walled in by the dense
      green of the hardhack. The sun roared on the green jungle but in the shade
      was sleepy peace, and the water was golden and rippling. Babbitt drew his
      hand through the cool flood, and mused:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never thought we'd come to Maine together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We've never done anything the way we thought we would. I expected to
      live in Germany with my granddad's people, and study the fiddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. And remember how I wanted to be a lawyer and go into politics?
      I still think I might have made a go of it. I've kind of got the gift of
      the gab&mdash;anyway, I can think on my feet, and make some kind of a
      spiel on most anything, and of course that's the thing you need in
      politics. By golly, Ted's going to law-school, even if I didn't! Well&mdash;I
      guess it's worked out all right. Myra's been a fine wife. And Zilla means
      well, Paulibus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Up here, I figure out all sorts of plans to keep her amused. I kind
      of feel life is going to be different, now that we're getting a good rest
      and can go back and start over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, old boy.&rdquo; Shyly: &ldquo;Say, gosh, it's been awful nice to sit
      around and loaf and gamble and act regular, with you along, you old
      horse-thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what it means to me, Georgie. Saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shame of emotion overpowered them; they cursed a little, to prove they
      were good rough fellows; and in a mellow silence, Babbitt whistling while
      Paul hummed, they paddled back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was Paul who had seemed overwrought, Babbitt who had been the
      protecting big brother, Paul became clear-eyed and merry, while Babbitt
      sank into irritability. He uncovered layer on layer of hidden weariness.
      At first he had played nimble jester to Paul and for him sought
      amusements; by the end of the week Paul was nurse, and Babbitt accepted
      favors with the condescension one always shows a patient nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before their families arrived, the women guests at the hotel
      bubbled, &ldquo;Oh, isn't it nice! You must be so excited;&rdquo; and the proprieties
      compelled Babbitt and Paul to look excited. But they went to bed early and
      grumpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Myra appeared she said at once, &ldquo;Now, we want you boys to go on
      playing around just as if we weren't here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first evening, he stayed out for poker with the guides, and she said
      in placid merriment, &ldquo;My! You're a regular bad one!&rdquo; The second evening,
      she groaned sleepily, &ldquo;Good heavens, are you going to be out every single
      night?&rdquo; The third evening, he didn't play poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tired now in every cell. &ldquo;Funny! Vacation doesn't seem to have done
      me a bit of good,&rdquo; he lamented. &ldquo;Paul's frisky as a colt, but I swear, I'm
      crankier and nervouser than when I came up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had three weeks of Maine. At the end of the second week he began to
      feel calm, and interested in life. He planned an expedition to climb
      Sachem Mountain, and wanted to camp overnight at Box Car Pond. He was
      curiously weak, yet cheerful, as though he had cleansed his veins of
      poisonous energy and was filling them with wholesome blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased to be irritated by Ted's infatuation with a waitress (his
      seventh tragic affair this year); he played catch with Ted, and with pride
      taught him to cast a fly in the pine-shadowed silence of Skowtuit Pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end he sighed, &ldquo;Hang it, I'm just beginning to enjoy my vacation.
      But, well, I feel a lot better. And it's going to be one great year! Maybe
      the Real Estate Board will elect me president, instead of some fuzzy
      old-fashioned faker like Chan Mott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, whenever he went into the smoking-compartment he felt
      guilty at deserting his wife and angry at being expected to feel guilty,
      but each time he triumphed, &ldquo;Oh, this is going to be a great year, a great
      old year!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      ALL the way home from Maine, Babbitt was certain that he was a changed
      man. He was converted to serenity. He was going to cease worrying about
      business. He was going to have more &ldquo;interests&rdquo;&mdash;theaters, public
      affairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy cigar,
      he was going to stop smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He invented a new and perfect method. He would buy no tobacco; he would
      depend on borrowing it; and, of course, he would be ashamed to borrow
      often. In a spasm of righteousness he flung his cigar-case out of the
      smoking-compartment window. He went back and was kind to his wife about
      nothing in particular; he admired his own purity, and decided, &ldquo;Absolutely
      simple. Just a matter of will-power.&rdquo; He started a magazine serial about a
      scientific detective. Ten miles on, he was conscious that he desired to
      smoke. He ducked his head, like a turtle going into its shell; he appeared
      uneasy; he skipped two pages in his story and didn't know it. Five miles
      later, he leaped up and sought the porter. &ldquo;Say, uh, George, have you got
      a&mdash;&rdquo; The porter looked patient. &ldquo;Have you got a time-table?&rdquo; Babbitt
      finished. At the next stop he went out and bought a cigar. Since it was to
      be his last before he reached Zenith, he finished it down to an inch stub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later he again remembered that he had stopped smoking, but he
      was too busy catching up with his office-work to keep it remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Baseball, he determined, would be an excellent hobby. &ldquo;No sense a man's
      working his fool head off. I'm going out to the Game three times a week.
      Besides, fellow ought to support the home team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did go and support the team, and enhance the glory of Zenith, by
      yelling &ldquo;Attaboy!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rotten!&rdquo; He performed the rite scrupulously. He
      wore a cotton handkerchief about his collar; he became sweaty; he opened
      his mouth in a wide loose grin; and drank lemon soda out of a bottle. He
      went to the Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised on
      watching the Advocate-Times bulletin-board. He stood in the thickest and
      steamiest of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded
      the achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher, Babbitt remarked to
      complete strangers, &ldquo;Pretty nice! Good work!&rdquo; and hastened back to the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He honestly believed that he loved baseball. It is true that he hadn't, in
      twenty-five years, himself played any baseball except back-lot catch with
      Ted&mdash;very gentle, and strictly limited to ten minutes. But the game
      was a custom of his clan, and it gave outlet for the homicidal and
      sides-taking instincts which Babbitt called &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; and &ldquo;love of
      sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the office he walked faster and faster, muttering, &ldquo;Guess
      better hustle.&rdquo; All about him the city was hustling, for hustling's sake.
      Men in motors were hustling to pass one another in the hustling traffic.
      Men were hustling to catch trolleys, with another trolley a minute behind,
      and to leap from the trolleys, to gallop across the sidewalk, to hurl
      themselves into buildings, into hustling express elevators. Men in dairy
      lunches were hustling to gulp down the food which cooks had hustled to
      fry. Men in barber shops were snapping, &ldquo;Jus' shave me once over. Gotta
      hustle.&rdquo; Men were feverishly getting rid of visitors in offices adorned
      with the signs, &ldquo;This Is My Busy Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lord Created the World in
      Six Days&mdash;You Can Spiel All You Got to Say in Six Minutes.&rdquo; Men who
      had made five thousand, year before last, and ten thousand last year, were
      urging on nerve-yelping bodies and parched brains so that they might make
      twenty thousand this year; and the men who had broken down immediately
      after making their twenty thousand dollars were hustling to catch trains,
      to hustle through the vacations which the hustling doctors had ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them Babbitt hustled back to his office, to sit down with nothing
      much to do except see that the staff looked as though they were hustling.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Every Saturday afternoon he hustled out to his country club and hustled
      through nine holes of golf as a rest after the week's hustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Zenith it was as necessary for a Successful Man to belong to a country
      club as it was to wear a linen collar. Babbitt's was the Outing Golf and
      Country Club, a pleasant gray-shingled building with a broad porch, on a
      daisy-starred cliff above Lake Kennepoose. There was another, the
      Tonawanda Country Club, to which belonged Charles McKelvey, Horace Updike,
      and the other rich men who lunched not at the Athletic but at the Union
      Club. Babbitt explained with frequency, &ldquo;You couldn't hire me to join the
      Tonawanda, even if I did have a hundred and eighty bucks to throw away on
      the initiation fee. At the Outing we've got a bunch of real human fellows,
      and the finest lot of little women in town&mdash;just as good at joshing
      as the men&mdash;but at the Tonawanda there's nothing but these would-be's
      in New York get-ups, drinking tea! Too much dog altogether. Why, I
      wouldn't join the Tonawanda even if they&mdash;I wouldn't join it on a
      bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had played four or five holes, he relaxed a bit, his
      tobacco-fluttering heart beat more normally, and his voice slowed to the
      drawling of his hundred generations of peasant ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      At least once a week Mr. and Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went to the movies.
      Their favorite motion-picture theater was the Chateau, which held three
      thousand spectators and had an orchestra of fifty pieces which played
      Arrangements from the Operas and suites portraying a Day on the Farm, or a
      Four-alarm Fire. In the stone rotunda, decorated with crown-embroidered
      velvet chairs and almost medieval tapestries, parrakeets sat on gilded
      lotos columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      With exclamations of &ldquo;Well, by golly!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You got to go some to beat
      this dump!&rdquo; Babbitt admired the Chateau. As he stared across the thousands
      of heads, a gray plain in the dimness, as he smelled good clothes and mild
      perfume and chewing-gum, he felt as when he had first seen a mountain and
      realized how very, very much earth and rock there was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked three kinds of films: pretty bathing girls with bare legs;
      policemen or cowboys and an industrious shooting of revolvers; and funny
      fat men who ate spaghetti. He chuckled with immense, moist-eyed
      sentimentality at interludes portraying puppies, kittens, and chubby
      babies; and he wept at deathbeds and old mothers being patient in
      mortgaged cottages. Mrs. Babbitt preferred the pictures in which handsome
      young women in elaborate frocks moved through sets ticketed as the
      drawing-rooms of New York millionaires. As for Tinka, she preferred, or
      was believed to prefer, whatever her parents told her to.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his relaxations&mdash;baseball, golf, movies, bridge, motoring, long
      talks with Paul at the Athletic Club, or at the Good Red Beef and Old
      English Chop House&mdash;were necessary to Babbitt, for he was entering a
      year of such activity as he had never known.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      IT was by accident that Babbitt had his opportunity to address the S. A.
      R. E. B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The S. A. R. E. B., as its members called it, with the universal passion
      for mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the State Association
      of Real Estate Boards; the organization of brokers and operators. It was
      to hold its annual convention at Monarch, Zenith's chief rival among the
      cities of the state. Babbitt was an official delegate; another was Cecil
      Rountree, whom Babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building,
      and hated for his social position, for being present at the smartest
      dances on Royal Ridge. Rountree was chairman of the convention
      program-committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had growled to him, &ldquo;Makes me tired the way these doctors and
      profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' A good
      realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are! I say: Why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at
      the S. A. R. E. B.?&rdquo; suggested Rountree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it would help you in making up the program&mdash;Tell you: the
      way I look at it is this: First place, we ought to insist that folks call
      us 'realtors' and not 'real-estate men.' Sounds more like a reg'lar
      profession. Second place&mdash;What is it distinguishes a profession from
      a mere trade, business, or occupation? What is it? Why, it's the public
      service and the skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all
      that, whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never
      considers the-public service and trained skill and so on. Now as a
      professional&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather! That's perfectly bully! Perfectly corking! Now you write it in a
      paper,&rdquo; said Rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      However accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and
      correspondence, Babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to
      prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid out a new fifteen-cent school exercise-book on his wife's
      collapsible sewing-table, set up for the event in the living-room. The
      household had been bullied into silence; Verona and Ted requested to
      disappear, and Tinka threatened with &ldquo;If I hear one sound out of you&mdash;if
      you holler for a glass of water one single solitary time&mdash;You better
      not, that's all!&rdquo; Mrs. Babbitt sat over by the piano, making a nightgown
      and gazing with respect while Babbitt wrote in the exercise-book, to the
      rhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose, damp and jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she
      marveled, &ldquo;I don't see how you can just sit down and make up things right
      out of your own head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in
      modern business life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had written seven pages, whereof the first page set forth:
    </p>
    <p>
      {illustration omitted: consists of several doodles and &ldquo;(1) a profession
      (2) Not just a trade crossed out (3) Skill &amp; vision (3) Shd be called
      &ldquo;realtor&rdquo; &amp; not just real est man"}
    </p>
    <p>
      The other six pages were rather like the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week he went about looking important. Every morning, as he dressed,
      he thought aloud: &ldquo;Jever stop to consider, Myra, that before a town can
      have buildings or prosperity or any of those things, some realtor has got
      to sell 'em the land? All civilization starts with him. Jever realize
      that?&rdquo; At the Athletic Club he led unwilling men aside to inquire, &ldquo;Say,
      if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would you start in
      with the funny stories or just kind of scatter 'em all through?&rdquo; He asked
      Howard Littlefield for a &ldquo;set of statistics about real-estate sales;
      something good and impressive,&rdquo; and Littlefield provided something
      exceedingly good and impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was to T. Cholmondeley Frink that Babbitt most often turned. He
      caught Frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while Frink looked
      hunted and evasive, &ldquo;Say, Chum&mdash;you're a shark on this writing stuff&mdash;how
      would you put this sentence, see here in my manuscript&mdash;manuscript
      now where the deuce is that?&mdash;oh, yes, here. Would you say 'We ought
      not also to alone think?' or 'We ought also not to think alone?' or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, Babbitt
      forgot about Style, Order, and the other mysteries, and scrawled off what
      he really thought about the real-estate business and about himself, and he
      found the paper written. When he read it to his wife she yearned, &ldquo;Why,
      dear, it's splendid; beautifully written, and so clear and interesting,
      and such splendid ideas! Why, it's just&mdash;it's just splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day he cornered Chum Frink and crowed, &ldquo;Well, old son, I finished it
      last evening! Just lammed it out! I used to think you writing-guys must
      have a hard job making up pieces, but Lord, it's a cinch. Pretty soft for
      you fellows; you certainly earn your money easy! Some day when I get ready
      to retire, guess I'll take to writing and show you boys how to do it. I
      always used to think I could write better stuff, and more punch and
      originality, than all this stuff you see printed, and now I'm doggone sure
      of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red title,
      had them bound in pale blue manilla, and affably presented one to old Ira
      Runyon, the managing editor of the Advocate-Times, who said yes, indeed
      yes, he was very glad to have it, and he certainly would read it all
      through&mdash;as soon as he could find time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt could not go to Monarch. She had a women's-club meeting.
      Babbitt said that he was very sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the five official delegates to the convention&mdash;Babbitt,
      Rountree, W. A. Rogers, Alvin Thayer, and Elbert Wing&mdash;there were
      fifty unofficial delegates, most of them with their wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met at the Union Station for the midnight train to Monarch. All of
      them, save Cecil Rountree, who was such a snob that he never wore badges,
      displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered &ldquo;We zoom for
      Zenith.&rdquo; The official delegates were magnificent with silver and magenta
      ribbons. Martin Lumsen's little boy Willy carried a tasseled banner
      inscribed &ldquo;Zenith the Zip City&mdash;Zeal, Zest and Zowie&mdash;1,000,000
      in 1935.&rdquo; As the delegates arrived, not in taxicabs but in the family
      automobile driven by the oldest son or by Cousin Fred, they formed
      impromptu processions through the station waiting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new and enormous waiting-room, with marble pilasters, and
      frescoes depicting the exploration of the Chaloosa River Valley by Pere
      Emile Fauthoux in 1740. The benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany;
      the news-stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill. Down the echoing spaces
      of the hall the delegates paraded after Willy Lumsen's banner, the men
      waving their cigars, the women conscious of their new frocks and strings
      of beads, all singing to the tune of Auld Lang Syne the official City
      Song, written by Chum Frink:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Good old Zenith,
     Our kin and kith,
     Wherever we may be,
     Hats in the ring,
     We blithely sing
     Of thy Prosperity.
</pre>
    <p>
      Warren Whitby, the broker, who had a gift of verse for banquets and
      birthdays, had added to Frink's City Song a special verse for the
      realtors' convention:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, here we come,
     The fellows from
     Zenith, the Zip Citee.
     We wish to state
     In real estate
     There's none so live as we.
</pre>
    <p>
      Babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. He leaped on a bench, shouting
      to the crowd:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with Zenith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's best ole town in the U. S. A.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeeeeeen-ith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious
      wonder&mdash;Italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken shoes,
      roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new
      but which were faded now and wrinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified.
      With Wing and Rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the
      waiting Pullmans. Motor-driven baggage-trucks and red-capped porters
      carrying bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity.
      Arc-lights glared and stammered overhead. The glossy yellow sleeping-cars
      shone impressively. Babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly; he
      thrust out his abdomen and rumbled, &ldquo;We got to see to it that the
      convention lets the Legislature understand just where they get off in this
      matter of taxing realty transfers.&rdquo; Wing uttered approving grunts and
      Babbitt swelled&mdash;gloated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind of a Pullman compartment was raised, and Babbitt looked into an
      unfamiliar world. The occupant of the compartment was Lucile McKelvey, the
      pretty wife of the millionaire contractor. Possibly, Babbitt thrilled, she
      was going to Europe! On the seat beside her was a bunch of orchids and
      violets, and a yellow paper-bound book which seemed foreign. While he
      stared, she picked up the book, then glanced out of the window as though
      she was bored. She must have looked straight at him, and he had met her,
      but she gave no sign. She languidly pulled down the blind, and he stood
      still, a cold feeling of insignificance in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from Sparta,
      Pioneer, and other smaller cities of the state, who listened respectfully
      when, as a magnifico from the metropolis of Zenith, he explained politics
      and the value of a Good Sound Business Administration. They fell joyfully
      into shop-talk, the purest and most rapturous form of conversation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd this fellow Rountree make out with this big apartment-hotel he was
      going to put up? Whadde do? Get out bonds to finance it?&rdquo; asked a Sparta
      broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you,&rdquo; said Babbitt. &ldquo;Now if I'd been handling it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; Elbert Wing was droning, &ldquo;I hired this shop-window for a week, and
      put up a big sign, 'Toy Town for Tiny Tots,' and stuck in a lot of doll
      houses and some dinky little trees, and then down at the bottom, 'Baby
      Likes This Dollydale, but Papa and Mama Will Prefer Our Beautiful
      Bungalows,' and you know, that certainly got folks talking, and first week
      we sold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trucks sang &ldquo;lickety-lick, lickety-lick&rdquo; as the train ran through the
      factory district. Furnaces spurted flame, and power-hammers were clanging.
      Red lights, green lights, furious white lights rushed past, and Babbitt
      was important again, and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      He did a voluptuous thing: he had his clothes pressed on the train. In the
      morning, half an hour before they reached Monarch, the porter came to his
      berth and whispered, &ldquo;There's a drawing-room vacant, sir. I put your suit
      in there.&rdquo; In tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas, Babbitt slipped down
      the green-curtain-lined aisle to the glory of his first private
      compartment. The porter indicated that he knew Babbitt was used to a
      man-servant; he held the ends of Babbitt's trousers, that the beautifully
      sponged garment might not be soiled, filled the bowl in the private
      washroom, and waited with a towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have a private washroom was luxurious. However enlivening a Pullman
      smoking-compartment was by night, even to Babbitt it was depressing in the
      morning, when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts, every hook
      filled with wrinkled cottony shirts, the leather seat piled with dingy
      toilet-kits, and the air nauseating with the smell of soap and toothpaste.
      Babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy, but now he reveled in
      it, reveled in his valet, and purred with pleasure as he gave the man a
      tip of a dollar and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rather hoped that he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed
      clothes, with the adoring porter carrying his suit-case, he disembarked at
      Monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to share a room at the Hotel Sedgwick with W. A. Rogers, that
      shrewd, rustic-looking Zenith dealer in farm-lands. Together they had a
      noble breakfast, with waffles, and coffee not in exiguous cups but in
      large pots. Babbitt grew expansive, and told Rogers about the art of
      writing; he gave a bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from the
      lobby, and sent to Tinka a post-card: &ldquo;Papa wishes you were here to bat
      round with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      The meetings of the convention were held in the ballroom of the Allen
      House. In an anteroom was the office of the chairman of the executive
      committee. He was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that
      he got nothing done whatever. He sat at a marquetry table, in a room
      littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and
      lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to
      him, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, &ldquo;Yes, yes, that's a fine
      idea; we'll do that,&rdquo; and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar
      and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him
      men kept beseeching, &ldquo;Say, Mr. Chairman&mdash;say, Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; without
      penetrating his exhausted hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the exhibit-room were plans of the new suburbs of Sparta, pictures of
      the new state capitol, at Galop de Vache, and large ears of corn with the
      label, &ldquo;Nature's Gold, from Shelby County, the Garden Spot of God's Own
      Country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in
      groups amid the badge-spotted crowd in the hotel-lobby, but there was a
      show of public meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of them opened with a welcome by the mayor of Monarch. The
      pastor of the First Christian Church of Monarch, a large man with a long
      damp frontal lock, informed God that the real-estate men were here now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable Minnemagantic realtor, Major Carlton Tuke, read a paper in
      which he denounced cooperative stores. William A. Larkin of Eureka gave a
      comforting prognosis of &ldquo;The Prospects for Increased Construction,&rdquo; and
      reminded them that plate-glass prices were two points lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convention was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delegates were entertained, incessantly and firmly. The Monarch
      Chamber of Commerce gave them a banquet, and the Manufacturers'
      Association an afternoon reception, at which a chrysanthemum was presented
      to each of the ladies, and to each of the men a leather bill-fold
      inscribed &ldquo;From Monarch the Mighty Motor Mart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crosby Knowlton, wife of the manufacturer of Fleetwing Automobiles,
      opened her celebrated Italian garden and served tea. Six hundred
      real-estate men and wives ambled down the autumnal paths. Perhaps three
      hundred of them were quietly inconspicuous; perhaps three hundred
      vigorously exclaimed, &ldquo;This is pretty slick, eh?&rdquo; surreptitiously picked
      the late asters and concealed them in their pockets, and tried to get near
      enough to Mrs. Knowlton to shake her lovely hand. Without request, the
      Zenith delegates (except Rountree) gathered round a marble dancing nymph
      and sang &ldquo;Here we come, the fellows from Zenith, the Zip Citee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that all the delegates from Pioneer belonged to the Brotherly
      and Protective Order of Elks, and they produced an enormous banner
      lettered: &ldquo;B. P. O. E.&mdash;Best People on Earth&mdash;Boost Pioneer, Oh
      Eddie.&rdquo; Nor was Galop de Vache, the state capital, to be slighted. The
      leader of the Galop de Vache delegation was a large, reddish, roundish
      man, but active. He took off his coat, hurled his broad black felt hat on
      the ground, rolled up his sleeves, climbed upon the sundial, spat, and
      bellowed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll tell the world, and the good lady who's giving the show this
      afternoon, that the bonniest burg in this man's state is Galop de Vache.
      You boys can talk about your zip, but jus' lemme murmur that old Galop has
      the largest proportion of home-owning citizens in the state; and when
      folks own their homes, they ain't starting labor-troubles, and they're
      raising kids instead of raising hell! Galop de Vache! The town for homey
      folks! The town that eats 'em alive oh, Bosco! We'll&mdash;tell&mdash;the&mdash;world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests drove off; the garden shivered into quiet. But Mrs. Crosby
      Knowlton sighed as she looked at a marble seat warm from five hundred
      summers of Amalfi. On the face of a winged sphinx which supported it some
      one had drawn a mustache in lead-pencil. Crumpled paper napkins were
      dumped among the Michaelmas daisies. On the walk, like shredded lovely
      flesh, were the petals of the last gallant rose. Cigarette stubs floated
      in the goldfish pool, trailing an evil stain as they swelled and
      disintegrated, and beneath the marble seat, the fragments carefully put
      together, was a smashed teacup.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rode back to the hotel Babbitt reflected, &ldquo;Myra would have enjoyed
      all this social agony.&rdquo; For himself he cared less for the garden party
      than for the motor tours which the Monarch Chamber of Commerce had
      arranged. Indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban
      trolley-stations, and tanneries. He devoured the statistics which were
      given to him, and marveled to his roommate, W. A. Rogers, &ldquo;Of course this
      town isn't a patch on Zenith; it hasn't got our outlook and natural
      resources; but did you know&mdash;I nev' did till to-day&mdash;that they
      manufactured seven hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last
      year? What d' you think of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached. When he stood
      on the low platform before the convention, he trembled and saw only a
      purple haze. But he was in earnest, and when he had finished the formal
      paper he talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled face a
      flashing disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight. They shouted
      &ldquo;That's the stuff!&rdquo; and in the discussion afterward they referred with
      impressiveness to &ldquo;our friend and brother, Mr. George F. Babbitt.&rdquo; He had
      in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as
      well known as that diplomat of business, Cecil Rountree. After the
      meeting, delegates from all over the state said, &ldquo;Hower you, Brother
      Babbitt?&rdquo; Sixteen complete strangers called him &ldquo;George,&rdquo; and three men
      took him into corners to confide, &ldquo;Mighty glad you had the courage to
      stand up and give the Profession a real boost. Now I've always maintained&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, with tremendous casualness, Babbitt asked the girl at the
      hotel news-stand for the newspapers from Zenith. There was nothing in the
      Press, but in the Advocate-Times, on the third page&mdash;He gasped. They
      had printed his picture and a half-column account. The heading was
      &ldquo;Sensation at Annual Land-men's Convention. G. F. Babbitt, Prominent
      Ziptown Realtor, Keynoter in Fine Address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He murmured reverently, &ldquo;I guess some of the folks on Floral Heights will
      sit up and take notice now, and pay a little attention to old Georgie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last meeting. The delegations were presenting the claims of
      their several cities to the next year's convention. Orators were
      announcing that &ldquo;Galop de Vache, the Capital City, the site of Kremer
      College and of the Upholtz Knitting Works, is the recognized center of
      culture and high-class enterprise;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Hamburg, the Big Little City
      with the Logical Location, where every man is open-handed and every woman
      a heaven-born hostess, throws wide to you her hospitable gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these more diffident invitations, the golden doors of the
      ballroom opened with a blatting of trumpets, and a circus parade rolled
      in. It was composed of the Zenith brokers, dressed as cowpunchers,
      bareback riders, Japanese jugglers. At the head was big Warren Whitby, in
      the bearskin and gold-and-crimson coat of a drum-major. Behind him, as a
      clown, beating a bass drum, extraordinarily happy and noisy, was Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warren Whitby leaped on the platform, made merry play with his baton, and
      observed, &ldquo;Boyses and girlses, the time has came to get down to cases. A
      dyed-in-the-wool Zenithite sure loves his neighbors, but we've made up our
      minds to grab this convention off our neighbor burgs like we've grabbed
      the condensed-milk business and the paper-box business and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      J. Harry Barmhill, the convention chairman, hinted, &ldquo;We're grateful to
      you, Mr. Uh, but you must give the other boys a chance to hand in their
      bids now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fog-horn voice blared, &ldquo;In Eureka we'll promise free motor rides through
      the prettiest country&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Running down the aisle, clapping his hands, a lean bald young man cried,
      &ldquo;I'm from Sparta! Our Chamber of Commerce has wired me they've set aside
      eight thousand dollars, in real money, for the entertainment of the
      convention!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A clerical-looking man rose to clamor, &ldquo;Money talks! Move we accept the
      bid from Sparta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee on Resolutions was reporting. They said that Whereas
      Almighty God in his beneficent mercy had seen fit to remove to a sphere of
      higher usefulness some thirty-six realtors of the state the past year,
      Therefore it was the sentiment of this convention assembled that they were
      sorry God had done it, and the secretary should be, and hereby was,
      instructed to spread these resolutions on the minutes, and to console the
      bereaved families by sending them each a copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second resolution authorized the president of the S.A.R.E.B. to spend
      fifteen thousand dollars in lobbying for sane tax measures in the State
      Legislature. This resolution had a good deal to say about Menaces to Sound
      Business and clearing the Wheels of Progress from ill-advised and
      shortsighted obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee on Committees reported, and with startled awe Babbitt
      learned that he had been appointed a member of the Committee on Torrens
      Titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rejoiced, &ldquo;I said it was going to be a great year! Georgie, old son,
      you got big things ahead of you! You're a natural-born orator and a good
      mixer and&mdash;Zowie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IX
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no formal entertainment provided for the last evening. Babbitt
      had planned to go home, but that afternoon the Jered Sassburgers of
      Pioneer suggested that Babbitt and W. A. Rogers have tea with them at the
      Catalpa Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teas were not unknown to Babbitt&mdash;his wife and he earnestly attended
      them at least twice a year&mdash;but they were sufficiently exotic to make
      him feel important. He sat at a glass-covered table in the Art Room of the
      Inn, with its painted rabbits, mottoes lettered on birch bark, and
      waitresses being artistic in Dutch caps; he ate insufficient lettuce
      sandwiches, and was lively and naughty with Mrs. Sassburger, who was as
      smooth and large-eyed as a cloak-model. Sassburger and he had met two days
      before, so they were calling each other &ldquo;Georgie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sassburger said prayerfully, &ldquo;Say, boys, before you go, seeing this is the
      last chance, I've GOT IT, up in my room, and Miriam here is the best
      little mixelogist in the Stati Unidos like us Italians say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With wide flowing gestures, Babbitt and Rogers followed the Sassburgers to
      their room. Mrs. Sassburger shrieked, &ldquo;Oh, how terrible!&rdquo; when she saw
      that she had left a chemise of sheer lavender crepe on the bed. She tucked
      it into a bag, while Babbitt giggled, &ldquo;Don't mind us; we're a couple o'
      little divvils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sassburger telephoned for ice, and the bell-boy who brought it said,
      prosaically and unprompted, &ldquo;Highball glasses or cocktail?&rdquo; Miriam
      Sassburger mixed the cocktails in one of those dismal, nakedly white
      water-pitchers which exist only in hotels. When they had finished the
      first round she proved by intoning &ldquo;Think you boys could stand another&mdash;you
      got a dividend coming&rdquo; that, though she was but a woman, she knew the
      complete and perfect rite of cocktail-drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, Babbitt hinted to Rogers, &ldquo;Say, W. A., old rooster, it comes over
      me that I could stand it if we didn't go back to the lovin' wives, this
      handsome ABEND, but just kind of stayed in Monarch and threw a party,
      heh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, you speak with the tongue of wisdom and sagashiteriferousness. El
      Wing's wife has gone on to Pittsburg. Let's see if we can't gather him
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven they sat in their room, with Elbert Wing and two
      up-state delegates. Their coats were off, their vests open, their faces
      red, their voices emphatic. They were finishing a bottle of corrosive
      bootlegged whisky and imploring the bell-boy, &ldquo;Say, son, can you get us
      some more of this embalming fluid?&rdquo; They were smoking large cigars and
      dropping ashes and stubs on the carpet. With windy guffaws they were
      telling stories. They were, in fact, males in a happy state of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt sighed, &ldquo;I don't know how it strikes you hellions, but personally
      I like this busting loose for a change, and kicking over a couple of
      mountains and climbing up on the North Pole and waving the aurora borealis
      around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man from Sparta, a grave, intense youngster, babbled, &ldquo;Say! I guess
      I'm as good a husband as the run of the mill, but God, I do get so tired
      of going home every evening, and nothing to see but the movies. That's why
      I go out and drill with the National Guard. I guess I got the nicest
      little wife in my burg, but&mdash;Say! Know what I wanted to do as a kid?
      Know what I wanted to do? Wanted to be a big chemist. Tha's what I wanted
      to do. But Dad chased me out on the road selling kitchenware, and here I'm
      settled down&mdash;settled for LIFE&mdash;not a chance! Oh, who the devil
      started this funeral talk? How 'bout 'nother lil drink? 'And a-noth-er
      drink wouldn' do 's 'ny harmmmmmmm.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea. Cut the sob-stuff,&rdquo; said W. A. Rogers genially. &ldquo;You boys know I'm
      the village songster? Come on now&mdash;sing up:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Said the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah,
     'I am dry, Obadiah, I am dry.'
     Said the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah,
     'So am I, Obadiah, so am I.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      They had dinner in the Moorish Grillroom of the Hotel Sedgwick. Somewhere,
      somehow, they seemed to have gathered in two other comrades: a
      manufacturer of fly-paper and a dentist. They all drank whisky from
      tea-cups, and they were humorous, and never listened to one another,
      except when W. A. Rogers &ldquo;kidded&rdquo; the Italian waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Gooseppy,&rdquo; he said innocently, &ldquo;I want a couple o' fried elephants'
      ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, sir, we haven't any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh? No elephants' ears? What do you know about that!&rdquo; Rogers turned to
      Babbitt. &ldquo;Pedro says the elephants' ears are all out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be switched!&rdquo; said the man from Sparta, with difficulty hiding
      his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in that case, Carlo, just bring me a hunk o' steak and a couple o'
      bushels o' French fried potatoes and some peas,&rdquo; Rogers went on. &ldquo;I
      suppose back in dear old sunny It' the Eyetalians get their fresh garden
      peas out of the can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, we have very nice peas in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a fact! Georgie, do you hear that? They get their fresh garden
      peas out of the garden, in Italy! By golly, you live and learn, don't you,
      Antonio, you certainly do live and learn, if you live long enough and keep
      your strength. All right, Garibaldi, just shoot me in that steak, with
      about two printers'-reams of French fried spuds on the promenade deck,
      comprehenez-vous, Michelovitch Angeloni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterward Elbert Wing admired, &ldquo;Gee, you certainly did have that poor Dago
      going, W. A. He couldn't make you out at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the Monarch Herald, Babbitt found an advertisement which he read aloud,
      to applause and laughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Colony Theatre
    </p>
    <p>
      Shake the Old Dogs to the WROLLICKING WRENS The bonniest bevy of beauteous
      bathing babes in burlesque. Pete Menutti and his Oh, Gee, Kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the straight steer, Benny, the painless chicklets of the
      Wrollicking Wrens are the cuddlingest bunch that ever hit town. Steer the
      feet, get the card board, and twist the pupils to the PDQest show ever.
      You will get 111% on your kale in this fun-fest. The Calroza Sisters are
      sure some lookers and will give you a run for your gelt. Jock Silbersteen
      is one of the pepper lads and slips you a dose of real laughter. Shoot the
      up and down to Jackson and West for graceful tappers. They run 1-2 under
      the wire. Provin and Adams will blow the blues in their laugh skit &ldquo;Hootch
      Mon!&rdquo; Something doing, boys. Listen to what the Hep Bird twitters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like a juicy show to me. Let's all take it in,&rdquo; said Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they put off departure as long as they could. They were safe while
      they sat here, legs firmly crossed under the table, but they felt
      unsteady; they were afraid of navigating the long and slippery floor of
      the grillroom under the eyes of the other guests and the too-attentive
      waiters.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they did venture, tables got in their way, and they sought to cover
      embarrassment by heavy jocularity at the coatroom. As the girl handed out
      their hats, they smiled at her, and hoped that she, a cool and expert
      judge, would feel that they were gentlemen. They croaked at one another,
      &ldquo;Who owns the bum lid?&rdquo; and &ldquo;You take a good one, George; I'll take what's
      left,&rdquo; and to the check-girl they stammered, &ldquo;Better come along, sister!
      High, wide, and fancy evening ahead!&rdquo; All of them tried to tip her, urging
      one another, &ldquo;No! Wait! Here! I got it right here!&rdquo; Among them, they gave
      her three dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      Flamboyantly smoking cigars they sat in a box at the burlesque show, their
      feet up on the rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed, worried, and
      inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more
      elementary chorus-evolutions, and a Jewish comedian made vicious fun of
      Jews. In the entr'actes they met other lone delegates. A dozen of them
      went in taxicabs out to Bright Blossom Inn, where the blossoms were made
      of dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a cow-stable
      no longer wisely used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, whisky was served openly, in glasses. Two or three clerks, who on
      pay-day longed to be taken for millionaires, sheepishly danced with
      telephone-girls and manicure-girls in the narrow space between the tables.
      Fantastically whirled the professionals, a young man in sleek
      evening-clothes and a slim mad girl in emerald silk, with amber hair flung
      up as jaggedly as flames. Babbitt tried to dance with her. He shuffled
      along the floor, too bulky to be guided, his steps unrelated to the rhythm
      of the jungle music, and in his staggering he would have fallen, had she
      not held him with supple kindly strength. He was blind and deaf from
      prohibition-era alcohol; he could not see the tables, the faces. But he
      was overwhelmed by the girl and her young pliant warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had firmly returned him to his group, he remembered, by a
      connection quite untraceable, that his mother's mother had been Scotch,
      and with head thrown back, eyes closed, wide mouth indicating ecstasy, he
      sang, very slowly and richly, &ldquo;Loch Lomond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that was the last of his mellowness and jolly companionship. The man
      from Sparta said he was a &ldquo;bum singer,&rdquo; and for ten minutes Babbitt
      quarreled with him, in a loud, unsteady, heroic indignation. They called
      for drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed. All the
      while Babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. When W. A.
      Rogers drawled, &ldquo;What say we go down the line and look over the girls?&rdquo; he
      agreed savagely. Before they went, three of them secretly made
      appointments with the professional dancing girl, who agreed &ldquo;Yes, yes,
      sure, darling&rdquo; to everything they said, and amiably forgot them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove back through the outskirts of Monarch, down streets of small
      brown wooden cottages of workmen, characterless as cells, as they rattled
      across warehouse-districts which by drunken night seemed vast and
      perilous, as they were borne toward the red lights and violent automatic
      pianos and the stocky women who simpered, Babbitt was frightened. He
      wanted to leap from the taxicab, but all his body was a murky fire, and he
      groaned, &ldquo;Too late to quit now,&rdquo; and knew that he did not want to quit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, they felt, one very humorous incident on the way. A broker from
      Minnemagantic said, &ldquo;Monarch is a lot sportier than Zenith. You Zenith
      tightwads haven't got any joints like these here.&rdquo; Babbitt raged, &ldquo;That's
      a dirty lie! Snothin' you can't find in Zenith. Believe me, we got more
      houses and hootch-parlors an' all kinds o' dives than any burg in the
      state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He realized they were laughing at him; he desired to fight; and forgot it
      in such musty unsatisfying experiments as he had not known since college.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, when he returned to Zenith, his desire for rebellion was
      partly satisfied. He had retrograded to a shamefaced contentment. He was
      irritable. He did not smile when W. A. Rogers complained, &ldquo;Ow, what a
      head! I certainly do feel like the wrath of God this morning. Say! I know
      what was the trouble! Somebody went and put alcohol in my booze last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's excursion was never known to his family, nor to any one in
      Zenith save Rogers and Wing. It was not officially recognized even by
      himself. If it had any consequences, they have not been discovered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      THIS autumn a Mr. W. G. Harding, of Marion, Ohio, was appointed President
      of the United States, but Zenith was less interested in the national
      campaign than in the local election. Seneca Doane, though he was a lawyer
      and a graduate of the State University, was candidate for mayor of Zenith
      on an alarming labor ticket. To oppose him the Democrats and Republicans
      united on Lucas Prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a perfect record for
      sanity. Mr. Prout was supported by the banks, the Chamber of Commerce, all
      the decent newspapers, and George F. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was precinct-leader on Floral Heights, but his district was safe
      and he longed for stouter battling. His convention paper had given him the
      beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the Republican-Democratic
      Central Committee sent him to the Seventh Ward and South Zenith, to
      address small audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with their
      new votes. He acquired a fame enduring for weeks. Now and then a reporter
      was present at one of his meetings, and the headlines (though they were
      not very large) indicated that George F. Babbitt had addressed Cheering
      Throng, and Distinguished Man of Affairs had pointed out the Fallacies of
      Doane. Once, in the rotogravure section of the Sunday Advocate-Times,
      there was a photograph of Babbitt and a dozen other business men, with the
      caption &ldquo;Leaders of Zenith Finance and Commerce Who Back Prout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He deserved his glory. He was an excellent campaigner. He had faith; he
      was certain that if Lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for Mr.
      W. G. Harding&mdash;unless he came to Zenith and electioneered for Lucas
      Prout. He did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; Prout represented
      honest industry, Seneca Doane represented whining laziness, and you could
      take your choice. With his broad shoulders and vigorous voice, he was
      obviously a Good Fellow; and, rarest of all, he really liked people. He
      almost liked common workmen. He wanted them to be well paid, and able to
      afford high rents&mdash;though, naturally, they must not interfere with
      the reasonable profits of stockholders. Thus nobly endowed, and keyed high
      by the discovery that he was a natural orator, he was popular with
      audiences, and he raged through the campaign, renowned not only in the
      Seventh and Eighth Wards but even in parts of the Sixteenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowded in his car, they came driving up to Turnverein Hall, South Zenith&mdash;Babbitt,
      his wife, Verona, Ted, and Paul and Zilla Riesling. The hall was over a
      delicatessen shop, in a street banging with trolleys and smelling of
      onions and gasoline and fried fish. A new appreciation of Babbitt filled
      all of them, including Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know how you keep it up, talking to three bunches in one evening.
      Wish I had your strength,&rdquo; said Paul; and Ted exclaimed to Verona, &ldquo;The
      old man certainly does know how to kid these roughnecks along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Men in black sateen shirts, their faces new-washed but with a hint of
      grime under their eyes, were loitering on the broad stairs up to the hall.
      Babbitt's party politely edged through them and into the whitewashed room,
      at the front of which was a dais with a red-plush throne and a pine altar
      painted watery blue, as used nightly by the Grand Masters and Supreme
      Potentates of innumerable lodges. The hall was full. As Babbitt pushed
      through the fringe standing at the back, he heard the precious tribute,
      &ldquo;That's him!&rdquo; The chairman bustled down the center aisle with an
      impressive, &ldquo;The speaker? All ready, sir! Uh&mdash;let's see&mdash;what
      was the name, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Babbitt slid into a sea of eloquence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen of the Sixteenth Ward, there is one who cannot be
      with us here to-night, a man than whom there is no more stalwart Trojan in
      all the political arena&mdash;I refer to our leader, the Honorable Lucas
      Prout, standard-bearer of the city and county of Zenith. Since he is not
      here, I trust that you will bear with me if, as a friend and neighbor, as
      one who is proud to share with you the common blessing of being a resident
      of the great city of Zenith, I tell you in all candor, honesty, and
      sincerity how the issues of this critical campaign appear to one plain man
      of business&mdash;to one who, brought up to the blessings of poverty and
      of manual labor, has, even when Fate condemned him to sit at a desk, yet
      never forgotten how it feels, by heck, to be up at five-thirty and at the
      factory with the ole dinner-pail in his hardened mitt when the whistle
      blew at seven, unless the owner sneaked in ten minutes on us and blew it
      early! (Laughter.) To come down to the basic and fundamental issues of
      this campaign, the great error, insincerely promulgated by Seneca Doane&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were workmen who jeered&mdash;young cynical workmen, for the most
      part foreigners, Jews, Swedes, Irishmen, Italians&mdash;but the older men,
      the patient, bleached, stooped carpenters and mechanics, cheered him; and
      when he worked up to his anecdote of Lincoln their eyes were wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modestly, busily, he hurried out of the hall on delicious applause, and
      sped off to his third audience of the evening. &ldquo;Ted, you better drive,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Kind of all in after that spiel. Well, Paul, how'd it go? Did I get
      'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully! Corking! You had a lot of pep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt worshiped, &ldquo;Oh, it was fine! So clear and interesting, and
      such nice ideas. When I hear you orating I realize I don't appreciate how
      profoundly you think and what a splendid brain and vocabulary you have.
      Just&mdash;splendid.&rdquo; But Verona was irritating. &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she worried, &ldquo;how
      do you know that public ownership of utilities and so on and so forth will
      always be a failure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt reproved, &ldquo;Rone, I should think you could see and realize
      that when your father's all worn out with orating, it's no time to expect
      him to explain these complicated subjects. I'm sure when he's rested he'll
      be glad to explain it to you. Now let's all be quiet and give Papa a
      chance to get ready for his next speech. Just think! Right now they're
      gathering in Maccabee Temple, and WAITING for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lucas Prout and Sound Business defeated Mr. Seneca Doane and Class
      Rule, and Zenith was again saved. Babbitt was offered several minor
      appointments to distribute among poor relations, but he preferred advance
      information about the extension of paved highways, and this a grateful
      administration gave to him. Also, he was one of only nineteen speakers at
      the dinner with which the Chamber of Commerce celebrated the victory of
      righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reputation for oratory established, at the dinner of the Zenith Real
      Estate Board he made the Annual Address. The Advocate-Times reported this
      speech with unusual fullness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the livest banquets that has recently been pulled off occurred
      last night in the annual Get-Together Fest of the Zenith Real Estate
      Board, held in the Venetian Ball Room of the O'Hearn House. Mine host Gil
      O'Hearn had as usual done himself proud and those assembled feasted on
      such an assemblage of plates as could be rivaled nowhere west of New York,
      if there, and washed down the plenteous feed with the cup which inspired
      but did not inebriate in the shape of cider from the farm of Chandler
      Mott, president of the board and who acted as witty and efficient
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Mr. Mott was suffering from slight infection and sore throat, G. F.
      Babbitt made the principal talk. Besides outlining the progress of
      Torrensing real estate titles, Mr. Babbitt spoke in part as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In rising to address you, with my impromptu speech carefully tucked into
      my vest pocket, I am reminded of the story of the two Irishmen, Mike and
      Pat, who were riding on the Pullman. Both of them, I forgot to say, were
      sailors in the Navy. It seems Mike had the lower berth and by and by he
      heard a terrible racket from the upper, and when he yelled up to find out
      what the trouble was, Pat answered, &ldquo;Shure an' bedad an' how can I ever
      get a night's sleep at all, at all? I been trying to get into this darned
      little hammock ever since eight bells!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, gentlemen, standing up here before you, I feel a good deal like
      Pat, and maybe after I've spieled along for a while, I may feel so darn
      small that I'll be able to crawl into a Pullman hammock with no trouble at
      all, at all!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Gentlemen, it strikes me that each year at this annual occasion when
      friend and foe get together and lay down the battle-ax and let the waves
      of good-fellowship waft them up the flowery slopes of amity, it behooves
      us, standing together eye to eye and shoulder to shoulder as
      fellow-citizens of the best city in the world, to consider where we are
      both as regards ourselves and the common weal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is true that even with our 361,000, or practically 362,000,
      population, there are, by the last census, almost a score of larger cities
      in the United States. But, gentlemen, if by the next census we do not
      stand at least tenth, then I'll be the first to request any knocker to
      remove my shirt and to eat the same, with the compliments of G. F.
      Babbitt, Esquire! It may be true that New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia
      will continue to keep ahead of us in size. But aside from these three
      cities, which are notoriously so overgrown that no decent white man,
      nobody who loves his wife and kiddies and God's good out-o'doors and likes
      to shake the hand of his neighbor in greeting, would want to live in them&mdash;and
      let me tell you right here and now, I wouldn't trade a high-class Zenith
      acreage development for the whole length and breadth of Broadway or State
      Street!&mdash;aside from these three, it's evident to any one with a head
      for facts that Zenith is the finest example of American life and
      prosperity to be found anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't mean to say we're perfect. We've got a lot to do in the way of
      extending the paving of motor boulevards, for, believe me, it's the fellow
      with four to ten thousand a year, say, and an automobile and a nice little
      family in a bungalow on the edge of town, that makes the wheels of
      progress go round!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's the type of fellow that's ruling America to-day; in fact, it's
      the ideal type to which the entire world must tend, if there's to be a
      decent, well-balanced, Christian, go-ahead future for this little old
      planet! Once in a while I just naturally sit back and size up this Solid
      American Citizen, with a whale of a lot of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Our Ideal Citizen&mdash;I picture him first and foremost as being busier
      than a bird-dog, not wasting a lot of good time in day-dreaming or going
      to sassiety teas or kicking about things that are none of his business,
      but putting the zip into some store or profession or art. At night he
      lights up a good cigar, and climbs into the little old 'bus, and maybe
      cusses the carburetor, and shoots out home. He mows the lawn, or sneaks in
      some practice putting, and then he's ready for dinner. After dinner he
      tells the kiddies a story, or takes the family to the movies, or plays a
      few fists of bridge, or reads the evening paper, and a chapter or two of
      some good lively Western novel if he has a taste for literature, and maybe
      the folks next-door drop in and they sit and visit about their friends and
      the topics of the day. Then he goes happily to bed, his conscience clear,
      having contributed his mite to the prosperity of the city and to his own
      bank-account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In politics and religion this Sane Citizen is the canniest man on earth;
      and in the arts he invariably has a natural taste which makes him pick out
      the best, every time. In no country in the world will you find so many
      reproductions of the Old Masters and of well-known paintings on parlor
      walls as in these United States. No country has anything like our number
      of phonographs, with not only dance records and comic but also the best
      operas, such as Verdi, rendered by the world's highest-paid singers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In other countries, art and literature are left to a lot of shabby bums
      living in attics and feeding on booze and spaghetti, but in America the
      successful writer or picture-painter is indistinguishable from any other
      decent business man; and I, for one, am only too glad that the man who has
      the rare skill to season his message with interesting reading matter and
      who shows both purpose and pep in handling his literary wares has a chance
      to drag down his fifty thousand bucks a year, to mingle with the biggest
      executives on terms of perfect equality, and to show as big a house and as
      swell a car as any Captain of Industry! But, mind you, it's the
      appreciation of the Regular Guy who I have been depicting which has made
      this possible, and you got to hand as much credit to him as to the authors
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Finally, but most important, our Standardized Citizen, even if he is a
      bachelor, is a lover of the Little Ones, a supporter of the hearthstone
      which is the basic foundation of our civilization, first, last, and all
      the time, and the thing that most distinguishes us from the decayed
      nations of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have never yet toured Europe&mdash;and as a matter of fact, I don't
      know that I care to such an awful lot, as long as there's our own mighty
      cities and mountains to be seen&mdash;but, the way I figure it out, there
      must be a good many of our own sort of folks abroad. Indeed, one of the
      most enthusiastic Rotarians I ever met boosted the tenets of
      one-hundred-per-cent pep in a burr that smacked o' bonny Scutlond and all
      ye bonny braes o' Bobby Burns. But same time, one thing that distinguishes
      us from our good brothers, the hustlers over there, is that they're
      willing to take a lot off the snobs and journalists and politicians, while
      the modern American business man knows how to talk right up for himself,
      knows how to make it good and plenty clear that he intends to run the
      works. He doesn't have to call in some highbrow hired-man when it's
      necessary for him to answer the crooked critics of the sane and efficient
      life. He's not dumb, like the old-fashioned merchant. He's got a
      vocabulary and a punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'With all modesty, I want to stand up here as a representative business
      man and gently whisper, &ldquo;Here's our kind of folks! Here's the
      specifications of the Standardized American Citizen! Here's the new
      generation of Americans: fellows with hair on their chests and smiles in
      their eyes and adding-machines in their offices. We're not doing any
      boasting, but we like ourselves first-rate, and if you don't like us, look
      out&mdash;better get under cover before the cyclone hits town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'So! In my clumsy way I have tried to sketch the Real He-man, the fellow
      with Zip and Bang. And it's because Zenith has so large a proportion of
      such men that it's the most stable, the greatest of our cities. New York
      also has its thousands of Real Folks, but New York is cursed with
      unnumbered foreigners. So are Chicago and San Francisco. Oh, we have a
      golden roster of cities&mdash;Detroit and Cleveland with their renowned
      factories, Cincinnati with its great machine-tool and soap products,
      Pittsburg and Birmingham with their steel, Kansas City and Minneapolis and
      Omaha that open their bountiful gates on the bosom of the ocean-like
      wheatlands, and countless other magnificent sister-cities, for, by the
      last census, there were no less than sixty-eight glorious American burgs
      with a population of over one hundred thousand! And all these cities stand
      together for power and purity, and against foreign ideas and communism&mdash;Atlanta
      with Hartford, Rochester with Denver, Milwaukee with Indianapolis, Los
      Angeles with Scranton, Portland, Maine, with Portland, Oregon. A good live
      wire from Baltimore or Seattle or Duluth is the twin-brother of every like
      fellow booster from Buffalo or Akron, Fort Worth or Oskaloosa!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But it's here in Zenith, the home for manly men and womanly women and
      bright kids, that you find the largest proportion of these Regular Guys,
      and that's what sets it in a class by itself; that's why Zenith will be
      remembered in history as having set the pace for a civilization that shall
      endure when the old time-killing ways are gone forever and the day of
      earnest efficient endeavor shall have dawned all round the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Some time I hope folks will quit handing all the credit to a lot of
      moth-eaten, mildewed, out-of-date, old, European dumps, and give proper
      credit to the famous Zenith spirit, that clean fighting determination to
      win Success that has made the little old Zip City celebrated in every land
      and clime, wherever condensed milk and pasteboard cartons are known!
      Believe me, the world has fallen too long for these worn-out countries
      that aren't producing anything but bootblacks and scenery and booze, that
      haven't got one bathroom per hundred people, and that don't know a
      loose-leaf ledger from a slip-cover; and it's just about time for some
      Zenithite to get his back up and holler for a show-down!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I tell you, Zenith and her sister-cities are producing a new type of
      civilization. There are many resemblances between Zenith and these other
      burgs, and I'm darn glad of it! The extraordinary, growing, and sane
      standardization of stores, offices, streets, hotels, clothes, and
      newspapers throughout the United States shows how strong and enduring a
      type is ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I always like to remember a piece that Chum Frink wrote for the
      newspapers about his lecture-tours. It is doubtless familiar to many of
      you, but if you will permit me, I'll take a chance and read it. It's one
      of the classic poems, like &ldquo;If&rdquo; by Kipling, or Ella Wheeler Wilcox's &ldquo;The
      Man Worth While&rdquo;; and I always carry this clipping of it in my note-book:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am out upon the road, a poet with a pedler's load I mostly sing a
      hearty song, and take a chew and hike along, a-handing out my samples fine
      of Cheero Brand of sweet sunshine, and peddling optimistic pokes and
      stable lines of japes and jokes to Lyceums and other folks, to Rotarys,
      Kiwanis' Clubs, and feel I ain't like other dubs. And then old Major Silas
      Satan, a brainy cuss who's always waitin', he gives his tail a lively
      quirk, and gets in quick his dirty work. He fills me up with mullygrubs;
      my hair the backward way he rubs; he makes me lonelier than a hound, on
      Sunday when the folks ain't round. And then b' gosh, I would prefer to
      never be a lecturer, a-ridin' round in classy cars and smoking fifty-cent
      cigars, and never more I want to roam; I simply want to be back home,
      a-eatin' flap jacks, hash, and ham, with folks who savvy whom I am!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I get that lonely spell, I simply seek the best hotel, no matter
      in what town I be&mdash;St. Paul, Toledo, or K.C., in Washington,
      Schenectady, in Louisville or Albany. And at that inn it hits my dome that
      I again am right at home. If I should stand a lengthy spell in front of
      that first-class hotel, that to the drummers loves to cater, across from
      some big film theayter; if I should look around and buzz, and wonder in
      what town I was, I swear that I could never tell! For all the crowd would
      be so swell, in just the same fine sort of jeans they wear at home, and
      all the queens with spiffy bonnets on their beans, and all the fellows
      standing round a-talkin' always, I'll be bound, the same good jolly kind
      of guff, 'bout autos, politics and stuff and baseball players of renown
      that Nice Guys talk in my home town!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then when I entered that hotel, I'd look around and say, &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo;
       For there would be the same news-stand, same magazines and candies grand,
      same smokes of famous standard brand, I'd find at home, I'll tell! And
      when I saw the jolly bunch come waltzing in for eats at lunch, and
      squaring up in natty duds to platters large of French Fried spuds, why
      then I'd stand right up and bawl, &ldquo;I've never left my home at all!&rdquo; And
      all replete I'd sit me down beside some guy in derby brown upon a lobby
      chair of plush, and murmur to him in a rush, &ldquo;Hello, Bill, tell me, good
      old scout, how is your stock a-holdin' out?&rdquo; Then we'd be off, two solid
      pals, a-chatterin' like giddy gals of flivvers, weather, home, and wives,
      lodge-brothers then for all our lives! So when Sam Satan makes you blue,
      good friend, that's what I'd up and do, for in these States where'er you
      roam, you never leave your home sweet home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir, these other burgs are our true partners in the great game of
      vital living. But let's not have any mistake about this. I claim that
      Zenith is the best partner and the fastest-growing partner of the whole
      caboodle. I trust I may be pardoned if I give a few statistics to back up
      my claims. If they are old stuff to any of you, yet the tidings of
      prosperity, like the good news of the Bible, never become tedious to the
      ears of a real hustler, no matter how oft the sweet story is told! Every
      intelligent person knows that Zenith manufactures more condensed milk and
      evaporated cream, more paper boxes, and more lighting-fixtures, than any
      other city in the United States, if not in the world. But it is not so
      universally known that we also stand second in the manufacture of
      package-butter, sixth in the giant realm of motors and automobiles, and
      somewhere about third in cheese, leather findings, tar roofing, breakfast
      food, and overalls!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Our greatness, however, lies not alone in punchful prosperity but
      equally in that public spirit, that forward-looking idealism and
      brotherhood, which has marked Zenith ever since its foundation by the
      Fathers. We have a right, indeed we have a duty toward our fair city, to
      announce broadcast the facts about our high schools, characterized by
      their complete plants and the finest school-ventilating systems in the
      country, bar none; our magnificent new hotels and banks and the paintings
      and carved marble in their lobbies; and the Second National Tower, the
      second highest business building in any inland city in the entire country.
      When I add that we have an unparalleled number of miles of paved streets,
      bathrooms vacuum cleaners, and all the other signs of civilization; that
      our library and art museum are well supported and housed in convenient and
      roomy buildings; that our park-system is more than up to par, with its
      handsome driveways adorned with grass, shrubs, and statuary, then I give
      but a hint of the all round unlimited greatness of Zenith!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I believe, however, in keeping the best to the last. When I remind you
      that we have one motor car for every five and seven-eighths persons in the
      city, then I give a rock-ribbed practical indication of the kind of
      progress and braininess which is synonymous with the name Zenith!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But the way of the righteous is not all roses. Before I close I must
      call your attention to a problem we have to face, this coming year. The
      worst menace to sound government is not the avowed socialists but a lot of
      cowards who work under cover&mdash;the long-haired gentry who call
      themselves &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; and &ldquo;radicals&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-partisan&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;intelligentsia&rdquo; and God only knows how many other trick names!
      Irresponsible teachers and professors constitute the worst of this whole
      gang, and I am ashamed to say that several of them are on the faculty of
      our great State University! The U. is my own Alma Mater, and I am proud to
      be known as an alumni, but there are certain instructors there who seem to
      think we ought to turn the conduct of the nation over to hoboes and
      roustabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Those profs are the snakes to be scotched&mdash;they and all their
      milk-and-water ilk! The American business man is generous to a fault. But
      one thing he does demand of all teachers and lecturers and journalists: if
      we're going to pay them our good money, they've got to help us by selling
      efficiency and whooping it up for rational prosperity! And when it comes
      to these blab-mouth, fault-finding, pessimistic, cynical University
      teachers, let me tell you that during this golden coming year it's just as
      much our duty to bring influence to have those cusses fired as it is to
      sell all the real estate and gather in all the good shekels we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not till that is done will our sons and daughters see that the ideal of
      American manhood and culture isn't a lot of cranks sitting around chewing
      the rag about their Rights and their Wrongs, but a God-fearing, hustling,
      successful, two-fisted Regular Guy, who belongs to some church with pep
      and piety to it, who belongs to the Boosters or the Rotarians or the
      Kiwanis, to the Elks or Moose or Red Men or Knights of Columbus or any one
      of a score of organizations of good, jolly, kidding, laughing, sweating,
      upstanding, lend-a-handing Royal Good Fellows, who plays hard and works
      hard, and whose answer to his critics is a square-toed boot that'll teach
      the grouches and smart alecks to respect the He-man and get out and root
      for Uncle Samuel, U.S.A.!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt promised to become a recognized orator. He entertained a Smoker of
      the Men's Club of the Chatham Road presbyterian Church with Irish, Jewish,
      and Chinese dialect stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in nothing was he more clearly revealed as the Prominent Citizen than
      in his lecture on &ldquo;Brass Tacks Facts on Real Estate,&rdquo; as delivered before
      the class in Sales Methods at the Zenith Y.M.C.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Advocate-Times reported the lecture so fully that Vergil Gunch said to
      Babbitt, &ldquo;You're getting to be one of the classiest spellbinders in town.
      Seems 's if I couldn't pick up a paper without reading about your
      well-known eloquence. All this guff ought to bring a lot of business into
      your office. Good work! Keep it up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, quit your kidding,&rdquo; said Babbitt feebly, but at this tribute from
      Gunch, himself a man of no mean oratorical fame, he expanded with delight
      and wondered how, before his vacation, he could have questioned the joys
      of being a solid citizen.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HIS march to greatness was not without disastrous stumbling.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fame did not bring the social advancement which the Babbitts deserved.
      They were not asked to join the Tonawanda Country Club nor invited to the
      dances at the Union. Himself, Babbitt fretted, he didn't &ldquo;care a fat hoot
      for all these highrollers, but the wife would kind of like to be Among
      Those Present.&rdquo; He nervously awaited his university class-dinner and an
      evening of furious intimacy with such social leaders as Charles McKelvey
      the millionaire contractor, Max Kruger the banker, Irving Tate the
      tool-manufacturer, and Adelbert Dobson the fashionable interior decorator.
      Theoretically he was their friend, as he had been in college, and when he
      encountered them they still called him &ldquo;Georgie,&rdquo; but he didn't seem to
      encounter them often, and they never invited him to dinner (with champagne
      and a butler) at their houses on Royal Ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the week before the class-dinner he thought of them. &ldquo;No reason why we
      shouldn't become real chummy now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all true American diversions and spiritual outpourings, the dinner of
      the men of the Class of 1896 was thoroughly organized. The
      dinner-committee hammered like a sales-corporation. Once a week they sent
      out reminders:
    </p>
    <p>
      TICKLER NO. 3
    </p>
    <p>
      Old man, are you going to be with us at the livest Friendship Feed the
      alumni of the good old U have ever known? The alumnae of '08 turned out
      60% strong. Are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of skirts? Come on,
      fellows, let's work up some real genuine enthusiasm and all boost together
      for the snappiest dinner yet! Elegant eats, short ginger-talks, and
      memories shared together of the brightest, gladdest days of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was held in a private room at the Union Club. The club was a
      dingy building, three pretentious old dwellings knocked together, and the
      entrance-hall resembled a potato cellar, yet the Babbitt who was free of
      the magnificence of the Athletic Club entered with embarrassment. He
      nodded to the doorman, an ancient proud negro with brass buttons and a
      blue tail-coat, and paraded through the hall, trying to look like a
      member.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty men had come to the dinner. They made islands and eddies in the
      hall; they packed the elevator and the corners of the private dining-room.
      They tried to be intimate and enthusiastic. They appeared to one another
      exactly as they had in college&mdash;as raw youngsters whose present
      mustaches, baldnesses, paunches, and wrinkles were but jovial disguises
      put on for the evening. &ldquo;You haven't changed a particle!&rdquo; they marveled.
      The men whom they could not recall they addressed, &ldquo;Well, well, great to
      see you again, old man. What are you&mdash;Still doing the same thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one was always starting a cheer or a college song, and it was always
      thinning into silence. Despite their resolution to be democratic they
      divided into two sets: the men with dress-clothes and the men without.
      Babbitt (extremely in dress-clothes) went from one group to the other.
      Though he was, almost frankly, out for social conquest, he sought Paul
      Riesling first. He found him alone, neat and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul sighed, &ldquo;I'm no good at this handshaking and 'well, look who's here'
      bunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats now, Paulibus, loosen up and be a mixer! Finest bunch of boys on
      earth! Say, you seem kind of glum. What's matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the usual. Run-in with Zilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! Let's wade in and forget our troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept Paul beside him, but worked toward the spot where Charles McKelvey
      stood warming his admirers like a furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKelvey had been the hero of the Class of '96; not only football captain
      and hammer-thrower but debater, and passable in what the State University
      considered scholarship. He had gone on, had captured the
      construction-company once owned by the Dodsworths, best-known pioneer
      family of Zenith. He built state capitols, skyscrapers, railway terminals.
      He was a heavy-shouldered, big-chested man, but not sluggish. There was a
      quiet humor in his eyes, a syrup-smooth quickness in his speech, which
      intimidated politicians and warned reporters; and in his presence the most
      intelligent scientist or the most sensitive artist felt thin-blooded,
      unworldly, and a little shabby. He was, particularly when he was
      influencing legislatures or hiring labor-spies, very easy and lovable and
      gorgeous. He was baronial; he was a peer in the rapidly crystallizing
      American aristocracy, inferior only to the haughty Old Families. (In
      Zenith, an Old Family is one which came to town before 1840.) His power
      was the greater because he was not hindered by scruples, by either the
      vice or the virtue of the older Puritan tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKelvey was being placidly merry now with the great, the manufacturers
      and bankers, the land-owners and lawyers and surgeons who had chauffeurs
      and went to Europe. Babbitt squeezed among them. He liked McKelvey's smile
      as much as the social advancement to be had from his favor. If in Paul's
      company he felt ponderous and protective, with McKelvey he felt slight and
      adoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard McKelvey say to Max Kruger, the banker, &ldquo;Yes, we'll put up Sir
      Gerald Doak.&rdquo; Babbitt's democratic love for titles became a rich relish.
      &ldquo;You know, he's one of the biggest iron-men in England, Max. Horribly
      well-off.... Why, hello, old Georgie! Say, Max, George Babbitt is getting
      fatter than I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chairman shouted, &ldquo;Take your seats, fellows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we make a move, Charley?&rdquo; Babbitt said casually to McKelvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. Hello, Paul! How's the old fiddler? Planning to sit anywhere
      special, George? Come on, let's grab some seats. Come on, Max. Georgie, I
      read about your speeches in the campaign. Bully work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, Babbitt would have followed him through fire. He was
      enormously busy during the dinner, now bumblingly cheering Paul, now
      approaching McKelvey with &ldquo;Hear, you're going to build some piers in
      Brooklyn,&rdquo; now noting how enviously the failures of the class, sitting by
      themselves in a weedy group, looked up to him in his association with the
      nobility, now warming himself in the Society Talk of McKelvey and Max
      Kruger. They spoke of a &ldquo;jungle dance&rdquo; for which Mona Dodsworth had
      decorated her house with thousands of orchids. They spoke, with an
      excellent imitation of casualness, of a dinner in Washington at which
      McKelvey had met a Senator, a Balkan princess, and an English
      major-general. McKelvey called the princess &ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; and let it be known
      that he had danced with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was thrilled, but not so weighted with awe as to be silent. If he
      was not invited by them to dinner, he was yet accustomed to talking with
      bank-presidents, congressmen, and clubwomen who entertained poets. He was
      bright and referential with McKelvey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Charley, juh remember in Junior year how we chartered a sea-going
      hack and chased down to Riverdale, to the big show Madame Brown used to
      put on? Remember how you beat up that hick constabule that tried to run us
      in, and we pinched the pants-pressing sign and took and hung it on Prof.
      Morrison's door? Oh, gosh, those were the days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those, McKelvey agreed, were the days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had reached &ldquo;It isn't the books you study in college but the
      friendships you make that counts&rdquo; when the men at head of the table broke
      into song. He attacked McKelvey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a shame, uh, shame to drift apart because our, uh, business
      activities lie in different fields. I've enjoyed talking over the good old
      days. You and Mrs. McKelvey must come to dinner some night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely, &ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to talk to you about the growth of real estate out beyond your
      Grantsville warehouse. I might be able to tip you off to a thing or two,
      possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! We must have dinner together, Georgie. Just let me know. And it
      will be a great pleasure to have your wife and you at the house,&rdquo; said
      McKelvey, much less vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the chairman's voice, that prodigious voice which once had roused
      them to cheer defiance at rooters from Ohio or Michigan or Indiana,
      whooped, &ldquo;Come on, you wombats! All together in the long yell!&rdquo; Babbitt
      felt that life would never be sweeter than now, when he joined with Paul
      Riesling and the newly recovered hero, McKelvey, in:
    </p>
    <p>
      Baaaaaattle-ax Get an ax, Bal-ax, Get-nax, Who, who? The U.! Hooroo!
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      The Babbitts invited the McKelveys to dinner, in early December, and the
      McKelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date once or twice,
      actually came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner, from
      the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted almonds to
      be placed before each person. Especially did they mention the matter of
      the other guests. To the last Babbitt held out for giving Paul Riesling
      the benefit of being with the McKelveys. &ldquo;Good old Charley would like Paul
      and Verg Gunch better than some highfalutin' Willy boy,&rdquo; he insisted, but
      Mrs. Babbitt interrupted his observations with, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I
      think I'll try to get some Lynnhaven oysters,&rdquo; and when she was quite
      ready she invited Dr. J. T. Angus, the oculist, and a dismally respectable
      lawyer named Maxwell, with their glittering wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Angus nor Maxwell belonged to the Elks or to the Athletic Club;
      neither of them had ever called Babbitt &ldquo;brother&rdquo; or asked his opinions on
      carburetors. The only &ldquo;human people&rdquo; whom she invited, Babbitt raged, were
      the Littlefields; and Howard Littlefield at times became so statistical
      that Babbitt longed for the refreshment of Gunch's, &ldquo;Well, old
      lemon-pie-face, what's the good word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after lunch Mrs. Babbitt began to set the table for the
      seven-thirty dinner to the McKelveys, and Babbitt was, by order, home at
      four. But they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times Mrs.
      Babbitt scolded, &ldquo;Do please try to keep out of the way!&rdquo; He stood in the
      door of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that Littlefield or Sam
      Doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. He saw Ted
      sneaking about the corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, old man?&rdquo; said Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, thin, owld one? Gee, Ma certainly is on the warpath! I told
      her Rone and I would jus' soon not be let in on the fiesta to-night, and
      she bit me. She says I got to take a bath, too. But, say, the Babbitt men
      will be some lookers to-night! Little Theodore in a dress-suit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Babbitt men!&rdquo; Babbitt liked the sound of it. He put his arm about the
      boy's shoulder. He wished that Paul Riesling had a daughter, so that Ted
      might marry her. &ldquo;Yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all right,&rdquo;
       he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and dutifully
      went in to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys' limousine, and
      their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt had
      brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked hard. He
      was good. He told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. He listened to the
      others. He started Maxwell off with a resounding, &ldquo;Let's hear about your
      trip to the Yellowstone.&rdquo; He was laudatory, extremely laudatory. He found
      opportunities to remark that Dr. Angus was a benefactor to humanity,
      Maxwell and Howard Littlefield profound scholars, Charles McKelvey an
      inspiration to ambitious youth, and Mrs. McKelvey an adornment to the
      social circles of Zenith, Washington, New York, Paris, and numbers of
      other places.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not stir them. It was a dinner without a soul. For no reason
      that was clear to Babbitt, heaviness was over them and they spoke
      laboriously and unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He concentrated on Lucille McKelvey, carefully not looking at her blanched
      lovely shoulder and the tawny silken bared which supported her frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll be going to Europe pretty soon again, won't you?&rdquo; he
      invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, what I really go for is: there's a little trattoria on the Via della
      Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife
      had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his coat, &ldquo;We
      must lunch together some time, and talk over the old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his
      wife, pleading, &ldquo;Charley said he had a corking time and we must lunch&mdash;said
      they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She achieved, &ldquo;Oh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are
      often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at
      once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly,
      without hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      For a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return
      dinner-invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hosts of Sir Gerald Doak, the McKelveys were headlined all the week
      after the Babbitts' dinner. Zenith ardently received Sir Gerald (who had
      come to America to buy coal). The newspapers interviewed him on
      prohibition, Ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of exchange,
      tea-drinking versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of American women, and
      daily life as lived by English county families. Sir Gerald seemed to have
      heard of all those topics. The McKelveys gave him a Singhalese dinner, and
      Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, society editor of the Advocate-Times, rose to her
      highest lark-note. Babbitt read aloud at breakfast-table:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twixt the original and Oriental decorations, the strange and delicious
      food, and the personalities both of the distinguished guests, the charming
      hostess and the noted host, never has Zenith seen a more recherche affair
      than the Ceylon dinner-dance given last evening by Mr. and Mrs. Charles
      McKelvey to Sir Gerald Doak. Methought as we&mdash;fortunate one!&mdash;were
      privileged to view that fairy and foreign scene, nothing at Monte Carlo or
      the choicest ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could be more lovely.
      It is not for nothing that Zenith is in matters social rapidly becoming
      known as the choosiest inland city in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he is too modest to admit it, Lord Doak gives a cachet to our smart
      quartier such as it has not received since the ever-memorable visit of the
      Earl of Sittingbourne. Not only is he of the British peerage, but he is
      also, on dit, a leader of the British metal industries. As he comes from
      Nottingham, a favorite haunt of Robin Hood, though now, we are informed by
      Lord Doak, a live modern city of 275,573 inhabitants, and important lace
      as well as other industries, we like to think that perhaps through his
      veins runs some of the blood, both virile red and bonny blue, of that
      earlier lord o' the good greenwood, the roguish Robin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovely Mrs. McKelvey never was more fascinating than last evening in
      her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at her exquisite
      waist a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt said bravely, &ldquo;I hope they don't invite us to meet this Lord Doak
      guy. Darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with Charley
      and the Missus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the Zenith Athletic Club they discussed it amply. &ldquo;I s'pose we'll have
      to call McKelvey 'Lord Chaz' from now on,&rdquo; said Sidney Finkelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It beats all get-out,&rdquo; meditated that man of data, Howard Littlefield,
      &ldquo;how hard it is for some people to get things straight. Here they call
      this fellow 'Lord Doak' when it ought to be 'Sir Gerald.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt marvelled, &ldquo;Is that a fact! Well, well! 'Sir Gerald,' eh? That's
      what you call um, eh? Well, sir, I'm glad to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later he informed his salesmen, &ldquo;It's funnier 'n a goat the way some folks
      that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go entertaining famous
      foreigners, don't have any more idea 'n a rabbit how to address 'em so's
      to make 'em feel at home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as he was driving home, he passed McKelvey's limousine and
      saw Sir Gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, Teutonic Englishman whose
      dribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful. Babbitt
      drove on slowly, oppressed by futility. He had a sudden, unexplained, and
      horrible conviction that the McKelveys were laughing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his
      wife, &ldquo;Folks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste on
      a bunch like the McKelveys. This society stuff is like any other hobby; if
      you devote yourself to it, you get on. But I like to have a chance to
      visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic chasing
      round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak of the McKelveys again.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about the
      Overbrooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ed Overbrook was a classmate of Babbitt who had been a failure. He had a
      large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of
      Dorchester. He was gray and thin and unimportant. He had always been gray
      and thin and unimportant. He was the person whom, in any group, you forgot
      to introduce, then introduced with extra enthusiasm. He had admired
      Babbitt's good-fellowship in college, had admired ever since his power in
      real estate, his beautiful house and wonderful clothes. It pleased
      Babbitt, though it bothered him with a sense of responsibility. At the
      class-dinner he had seen poor Overbrook, in a shiny blue serge
      business-suit, being diffident in a corner with three other failures. He
      had gone over and been cordial: &ldquo;Why, hello, young Ed! I hear you're
      writing all the insurance in Dorchester now. Bully work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They recalled the good old days when Overbrook used to write poetry.
      Overbrook embarrassed him by blurting, &ldquo;Say, Georgie, I hate to think of
      how we been drifting apart. I wish you and Mrs. Babbitt would come to
      dinner some night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt boomed, &ldquo;Fine! Sure! Just let me know. And the wife and I want to
      have you at the house.&rdquo; He forgot it, but unfortunately Ed Overbrook did
      not. Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner. &ldquo;Might
      as well go and get it over,&rdquo; Babbitt groaned to his wife. &ldquo;But don't it
      simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about
      social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting
      down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it.
      That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accepted Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two
      weeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so
      appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes
      dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of
      their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to
      the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at
      six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt permitted
      himself to be ten minutes late. &ldquo;Let's make it as short as possible. I
      think we'll duck out quick. I'll say I have to be at the office extra
      early to-morrow,&rdquo; he planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Overbrook house was depressing. It was the second story of a wooden
      two-family dwelling; a place of baby-carriages, old hats hung in the hall,
      cabbage-smell, and a Family Bible on the parlor table. Ed Overbrook and
      his wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual, and the other guests
      were two dreadful families whose names Babbitt never caught and never
      desired to catch. But he was touched, and disconcerted, by the tactless
      way in which Overbrook praised him: &ldquo;We're mighty proud to have old George
      here to-night! Of course you've all read about his speeches and oratory in
      the papers&mdash;and the boy's good-looking, too, eh?&mdash;but what I
      always think of is back in college, and what a great old mixer he was, and
      one of the best swimmers in the class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt tried to be jovial; he worked at it; but he could find nothing to
      interest him in Overbrook's timorousness, the blankness of the other
      guests, or the drained stupidity of Mrs. Overbrook, with her spectacles,
      drab skin, and tight-drawn hair. He told his best Irish story, but it sank
      like soggy cake. Most bleary moment of all was when Mrs. Overbrook,
      peering out of her fog of nursing eight children and cooking and
      scrubbing, tried to be conversational.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you go to Chicago and New York right along, Mr. Babbitt,&rdquo; she
      prodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I get to Chicago fairly often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be awfully interesting. I suppose you take in all the theaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, Mrs. Overbrook, thing that hits me best is a
      great big beefsteak at a Dutch restaurant in the Loop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had nothing more to say. Babbitt was sorry, but there was no hope;
      the dinner was a failure. At ten, rousing out of the stupor of meaningless
      talk, he said as cheerily as he could, &ldquo;'Fraid we got to be starting, Ed.
      I've got a fellow coming to see me early to-morrow.&rdquo; As Overbrook helped
      him with his coat, Babbitt said, &ldquo;Nice to rub up on the old days! We must
      have lunch together, P.D.Q.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt sighed, on their drive home, &ldquo;It was pretty terrible. But how
      Mr. Overbrook does admire you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. Poor cuss! Seems to think I'm a little tin archangel, and the
      best-looking man in Zenith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're certainly not that but&mdash;Oh, Georgie, you don't suppose
      we have to invite them to dinner at our house now, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouch! Gaw, I hope not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, now, George! You didn't say anything about it to Mr. Overbrook,
      did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Gee! No! Honest, I didn't! Just made a bluff about having him to
      lunch some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.... Oh, dear.... I don't want to hurt their feelings. But I don't
      see how I could stand another evening like this one. And suppose somebody
      like Dr. and Mrs. Angus came in when we had the Overbrooks there, and
      thought they were friends of ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a week they worried, &ldquo;We really ought to invite Ed and his wife, poor
      devils!&rdquo; But as they never saw the Overbrooks, they forgot them, and after
      a month or two they said, &ldquo;That really was the best way, just to let it
      slide. It wouldn't be kind to THEM to have them here. They'd feel so out
      of place and hard-up in our home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak of the Overbrooks again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE certainty that he was not going to be accepted by the McKelveys made
      Babbitt feel guilty and a little absurd. But he went more regularly to the
      Elks; at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon he was oratorical regarding the
      wickedness of strikes; and again he saw himself as a Prominent Citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      His clubs and associations were food comfortable to his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a decent man in Zenith it was required that he should belong to one,
      preferably two or three, of the innumerous &ldquo;lodges&rdquo; and
      prosperity-boosting lunch-clubs; to the Rotarians, the Kiwanis, or the
      Boosters; to the Oddfellows, Moose, Masons, Red Men, Woodmen, Owls,
      Eagles, Maccabees, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Columbus, and other
      secret orders characterized by a high degree of heartiness, sound morals,
      and reverence for the Constitution. There were four reasons for joining
      these orders: It was the thing to do. It was good for business, since
      lodge-brothers frequently became customers. It gave to Americans unable to
      become Geheimrate or Commendatori such unctuous honorifics as High Worthy
      Recording Scribe and Grand Hoogow to add to the commonplace distinctions
      of Colonel, Judge, and Professor. And it permitted the swaddled American
      husband to stay away from home for one evening a week. The lodge was his
      piazza, his pavement cafe. He could shoot pool and talk man-talk and be
      obscene and valiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was what he called a &ldquo;joiner&rdquo; for all these reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the dun
      background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of properties
      to rent. The evenings of oratory and committees and lodges stimulated him
      like brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. Week by week he
      accumulated nervousness. He was in open disagreement with his outside
      salesman, Stanley Graff; and once, though her charms had always kept him
      nickeringly polite to her, he snarled at Miss McGoun for changing his
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the presence of Paul Riesling he relaxed. At least once a week they
      fled from maturity. On Saturday they played golf, jeering, &ldquo;As a golfer,
      you're a fine tennis-player,&rdquo; or they motored all Sunday afternoon,
      stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a counter and
      drink coffee from thick cups. Sometimes Paul came over in the evening with
      his violin, and even Zilla was silent as the lonely man who had lost his
      way and forever crept down unfamiliar roads spun out his dark soul in
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing gave Babbitt more purification and publicity than his labors for
      the Sunday School.
    </p>
    <p>
      His church, the Chatham Road Presbyterian, was one of the largest and
      richest, one of the most oaken and velvety, in Zenith. The pastor was the
      Reverend John Jennison Drew, M.A., D.D., LL.D. (The M.A. and the D.D. were
      from Elbert University, Nebraska, the LL.D. from Waterbury College,
      Oklahoma.) He was eloquent, efficient, and versatile. He presided at
      meetings for the denunciation of unions or the elevation of domestic
      service, and confided to the audiences that as a poor boy he had carried
      newspapers. For the Saturday edition of the Evening Advocate he wrote
      editorials on &ldquo;The Manly Man's Religion&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dollars and Sense Value
      of Christianity,&rdquo; which were printed in bold type surrounded by a wiggly
      border. He often said that he was &ldquo;proud to be known as primarily a
      business man&rdquo; and that he certainly was not going to &ldquo;permit the old Satan
      to monopolize all the pep and punch.&rdquo; He was a thin, rustic-faced young
      man with gold spectacles and a bang of dull brown hair, but when he hurled
      himself into oratory he glowed with power. He admitted that he was too
      much the scholar and poet to imitate the evangelist, Mike Monday, yet he
      had once awakened his fold to new life, and to larger collections, by the
      challenge, &ldquo;My brethren, the real cheap skate is the man who won't lend to
      the Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had made his church a true community center. It contained everything
      but a bar. It had a nursery, a Thursday evening supper with a short bright
      missionary lecture afterward, a gymnasium, a fortnightly motion-picture
      show, a library of technical books for young workmen&mdash;though,
      unfortunately, no young workman ever entered the church except to wash the
      windows or repair the furnace&mdash;and a sewing-circle which made short
      little pants for the children of the poor while Mrs. Drew read aloud from
      earnest novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Dr. Drew's theology was Presbyterian, his church-building was
      gracefully Episcopalian. As he said, it had the &ldquo;most perdurable features
      of those noble ecclesiastical monuments of grand Old England which stand
      as symbols of the eternity of faith, religious and civil.&rdquo; It was built of
      cheery iron-spot brick in an improved Gothic style, and the main
      auditorium had indirect lighting from electric globes in lavish alabaster
      bowls.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John Jennison
      Drew was unusually eloquent. The crowd was immense. Ten brisk young
      ushers, in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding chairs up
      from the basement. There was an impressive musical program, conducted by
      Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who also sang the
      offertory. Babbitt cared less for this, because some misguided person had
      taught young Mr. Smeeth to smile, smile, smile while he was singing, but
      with all the appreciation of a fellow-orator he admired Dr. Drew's sermon.
      It had the intellectual quality which distinguished the Chatham Road
      congregation from the grubby chapels on Smith Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this abundant harvest-time of all the year,&rdquo; Dr. Drew chanted, &ldquo;when,
      though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer, yet
      the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o'er all the labors and
      desires of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me there sounds
      behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those
      passed happily on; and lo! on the dim horizon we see behind dolorous
      clouds the mighty mass of mountains&mdash;mountains of melody, mountains
      of mirth, mountains of might!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do like a sermon with culture and thought in it,&rdquo; meditated
      Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the service he was delighted when the pastor, actively
      shaking hands at the door, twittered, &ldquo;Oh, Brother Babbitt, can you wait a
      jiffy? Want your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, doctor! You bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop into my office. I think you'll like the cigars there.&rdquo; Babbitt did
      like the cigars. He also liked the office, which was distinguished from
      other offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wall-placard to
      &ldquo;This is the Lord's Busy Day.&rdquo; Chum Frink came in, then William W.
      Eathorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eathorne was the seventy-year-old president of the First State Bank of
      Zenith. He still wore the delicate patches of side-whiskers which had been
      the uniform of bankers in 1870. If Babbitt was envious of the Smart Set of
      the McKelveys, before William Washington Eathorne he was reverent. Mr.
      Eathorne had nothing to do with the Smart Set. He was above it. He was the
      great-grandson of one of the five men who founded Zenith, in 1792, and he
      was of the third generation of bankers. He could examine credits, make
      loans, promote or injure a man's business. In his presence Babbitt
      breathed quickly and felt young.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Dr. Drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've asked you gentlemen to stay so I can put a proposition before you.
      The Sunday School needs bucking up. It's the fourth largest in Zenith, but
      there's no reason why we should take anybody's dust. We ought to be first.
      I want to request you, if you will, to form a committee of advice and
      publicity for the Sunday School; look it over and make any suggestions for
      its betterment, and then, perhaps, see that the press gives us some
      attention&mdash;give the public some really helpful and constructive news
      instead of all these murders and divorces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt and Frink were enchanted to join him.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      If you had asked Babbitt what his religion was, he would have answered in
      sonorous Boosters'-Club rhetoric, &ldquo;My religion is to serve my fellow men,
      to honor my brother as myself, and to do my bit to make life happier for
      one and all.&rdquo; If you had pressed him for more detail, he would have
      announced, &ldquo;I'm a member of the Presbyterian Church, and naturally, I
      accept its doctrines.&rdquo; If you had been so brutal as to go on, he would
      have protested, &ldquo;There's no use discussing and arguing about religion; it
      just stirs up bad feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Actually, the content of his theology was that there was a supreme being
      who had tried to make us perfect, but presumably had failed; that if one
      was a Good Man he would go to a place called Heaven (Babbitt unconsciously
      pictured it as rather like an excellent hotel with a private garden), but
      if one was a Bad Man, that is, if he murdered or committed burglary or
      used cocaine or had mistresses or sold non-existent real estate, he would
      be punished. Babbitt was uncertain, however, about what he called &ldquo;this
      business of Hell.&rdquo; He explained to Ted, &ldquo;Of course I'm pretty liberal; I
      don't exactly believe in a fire-and-brimstone Hell. Stands to reason,
      though, that a fellow can't get away with all sorts of Vice and not get
      nicked for it, see how I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this theology he rarely pondered. The kernel of his practical
      religion was that it was respectable, and beneficial to one's business, to
      be seen going to services; that the church kept the Worst Elements from
      being still worse; and that the pastor's sermons, however dull they might
      seem at the time of taking, yet had a voodooistic power which &ldquo;did a
      fellow good&mdash;kept him in touch with Higher Things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His first investigations for the Sunday School Advisory Committee did not
      inspire him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked the Busy Folks' Bible Class, composed of mature men and women and
      addressed by the old-school physician, Dr. T. Atkins Jordan, in a
      sparkling style comparable to that of the more refined humorous
      after-dinner speakers, but when he went down to the junior classes he was
      disconcerted. He heard Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the
      Y.M.C.A. and leader of the church-choir, a pale but strenuous young man
      with curly hair and a smile, teaching a class of sixteen-year-old boys.
      Smeeth lovingly admonished them, &ldquo;Now, fellows, I'm going to have a Heart
      to Heart Talk Evening at my house next Thursday. We'll get off by
      ourselves and be frank about our Secret Worries. You can just tell old
      Sheldy anything, like all the fellows do at the Y. I'm going to explain
      frankly about the horrible practises a kiddy falls into unless he's guided
      by a Big Brother, and about the perils and glory of Sex.&rdquo; Old Sheldy
      beamed damply; the boys looked ashamed; and Babbitt didn't know which way
      to turn his embarrassed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less annoying but also much duller were the minor classes which were being
      instructed in philosophy and Oriental ethnology by earnest spinsters. Most
      of them met in the highly varnished Sunday School room, but there was an
      overflow to the basement, which was decorated with varicose water-pipes
      and lighted by small windows high up in the oozing wall. What Babbitt saw,
      however, was the First Congregational Church of Catawba. He was back in
      the Sunday School of his boyhood. He smelled again that polite stuffiness
      to be found only in church parlors; he recalled the case of drab Sunday
      School books: &ldquo;Hetty, a Humble Heroine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Josephus, a Lad of
      Palestine;&rdquo; he thumbed once more the high-colored text-cards which no boy
      wanted but no boy liked to throw away, because they were somehow sacred;
      he was tortured by the stumbling rote of thirty-five years ago, as in the
      vast Zenith church he listened to:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Edgar, you read the next verse. What does it mean when it says it's
      easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye? What does this teach us?
      Clarence! Please don't wiggle so! If you had studied your lesson you
      wouldn't be so fidgety. Now, Earl, what is the lesson Jesus was trying to
      teach his disciples? The one thing I want you to especially remember,
      boys, is the words, 'With God all things are possible.' Just think of that
      always&mdash;Clarence, PLEASE pay attention&mdash;just say 'With God all
      things are possible' whenever you feel discouraged, and, Alec, will you
      read the next verse; if you'd pay attention you wouldn't lose your place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drone&mdash;drone&mdash;drone&mdash;gigantic bees that boomed in a cavern
      of drowsiness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt started from his open-eyed nap, thanked the teacher for &ldquo;the
      privilege of listening to her splendid teaching,&rdquo; and staggered on to the
      next circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two weeks of this he had no suggestions whatever for the Reverend
      Dr. Drew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he discovered a world of Sunday School journals, an enormous and busy
      domain of weeklies and monthlies which were as technical, as practical and
      forward-looking, as the real-estate columns or the shoe-trade magazines.
      He bought half a dozen of them at a religious book-shop and till after
      midnight he read them and admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found many lucrative tips on &ldquo;Focusing Appeals,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scouting for New
      Members,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Getting Prospects to Sign up with the Sunday School.&rdquo; He
      particularly liked the word &ldquo;prospects,&rdquo; and he was moved by the rubric:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moral springs of the community's life lie deep in its Sunday Schools&mdash;its
      schools of religious instruction and inspiration. Neglect now means loss
      of spiritual vigor and moral power in years to come.... Facts like the
      above, followed by a straight-arm appeal, will reach folks who can never
      be laughed or jollied into doing their part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt admitted, &ldquo;That's so. I used to skin out of the ole Sunday School
      at Catawba every chance I got, but same time, I wouldn't be where I am
      to-day, maybe, if it hadn't been for its training in&mdash;in moral power.
      And all about the Bible. (Great literature. Have to read some of it again,
      one of these days).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How scientifically the Sunday School could be organized he learned from an
      article in the Westminster Adult Bible Class:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second vice-president looks after the fellowship of the class. She
      chooses a group to help her. These become ushers. Every one who comes gets
      a glad hand. No one goes away a stranger. One member of the group stands
      on the doorstep and invites passers-by to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps most of all Babbitt appreciated the remarks by William H. Ridgway
      in the Sunday School Times:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have a Sunday School class without any pep and get-up-and-go in
      it, that is, without interest, that is uncertain in attendance, that acts
      like a fellow with the spring fever, let old Dr. Ridgway write you a
      prescription. Rx. Invite the Bunch for Supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday School journals were as well rounded as they were practical.
      They neglected none of the arts. As to music the Sunday School Times
      advertised that C. Harold Lowden, &ldquo;known to thousands through his sacred
      compositions,&rdquo; had written a new masterpiece, &ldquo;entitled 'Yearning for
      You.' The poem, by Harry D. Kerr, is one of the daintiest you could
      imagine and the music is indescribably beautiful. Critics are agreed that
      it will sweep the country. May be made into a charming sacred song by
      substituting the hymn words, 'I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even manual training was adequately considered. Babbitt noted an ingenious
      way of illustrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Model for Pupils to Make. Tomb with Rolling Door.&mdash;Use a square
      covered box turned upside down. Pull the cover forward a little to form a
      groove at the bottom. Cut a square door, also cut a circle of cardboard to
      more than cover the door. Cover the circular door and the tomb thickly
      with stiff mixture of sand, flour and water and let it dry. It was the
      heavy circular stone over the door the women found 'rolled away' on Easter
      morning. This is the story we are to 'Go-tell.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In their advertisements the Sunday School journals were thoroughly
      efficient. Babbitt was interested in a preparation which &ldquo;takes the place
      of exercise for sedentary men by building up depleted nerve tissue,
      nourishing the brain and the digestive system.&rdquo; He was edified to learn
      that the selling of Bibles was a hustling and strictly competitive
      industry, and as an expert on hygiene he was pleased by the Sanitary
      Communion Outfit Company's announcement of &ldquo;an improved and satisfactory
      outfit throughout, including highly polished beautiful mahogany tray. This
      tray eliminates all noise, is lighter and more easily handled than others
      and is more in keeping with the furniture of the church than a tray of any
      other material.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the pile of Sunday School journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered, &ldquo;Now, there's a real he-world. Corking!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed I haven't sat in more. Fellow that's an influence in the
      community&mdash;shame if he doesn't take part in a real virile hustling
      religion. Sort of Christianity Incorporated, you might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with all reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks might claim these Sunday School fans are undignified and
      unspiritual and so on. Sure! Always some skunk to spring things like that!
      Knocking and sneering and tearing-down&mdash;so much easier than building
      up. But me, I certainly hand it to these magazines. They've brought ole
      George F. Babbitt into camp, and that's the answer to the critics!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more manly and practical a fellow is, the more he ought to lead the
      enterprising Christian life. Me for it! Cut out this carelessness and
      boozing and&mdash;Rone! Where the devil you been? This is a fine time o'
      night to be coming in!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THERE are but three or four old houses in Floral Heights, and in Floral
      Heights an old house is one which was built before 1880. The largest of
      these is the residence of William Washington Eathorne, president of the
      First State Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eathorne Mansion preserves the memory of the &ldquo;nice parts&rdquo; of Zenith as
      they appeared from 1860 to 1900. It is a red brick immensity with gray
      sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red, green, and
      dyspeptic yellow. There are two anemic towers, one roofed with copper, the
      other crowned with castiron ferns. The porch is like an open tomb; it is
      supported by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen cascades of
      brick. At one side of the house is a huge stained-glass window in the
      shape of a keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the house has an effect not at all humorous. It embodies the heavy
      dignity of those Victorian financiers who ruled the generation between the
      pioneers and the brisk &ldquo;sales-engineers&rdquo; and created a somber oligarchy by
      gaining control of banks, mills, land, railroads, mines. Out of the dozen
      contradictory Zeniths which together make up the true and complete Zenith,
      none is so powerful and enduring yet none so unfamiliar to the citizens as
      the small, still, dry, polite, cruel Zenith of the William Eathornes; and
      for that tiny hierarchy the other Zeniths unwittingly labor and
      insignificantly die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the castles of the testy Victorian tetrarchs are gone now or
      decayed into boarding-houses, but the Eathorne Mansion remains virtuous
      and aloof, reminiscent of London, Back Bay, Rittenhouse Square. Its marble
      steps are scrubbed daily, the brass plate is reverently polished, and the
      lace curtains are as prim and superior as William Washington Eathorne
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a certain awe Babbitt and Chum Frink called on Eathorne for a meeting
      of the Sunday School Advisory Committee; with uneasy stillness they
      followed a uniformed maid through catacombs of reception-rooms to the
      library. It was as unmistakably the library of a solid old banker as
      Eathorne's side-whiskers were the side-whiskers of a solid old banker. The
      books were most of them Standard Sets, with the correct and traditional
      touch of dim blue, dim gold, and glossy calf-skin. The fire was exactly
      correct and traditional; a small, quiet, steady fire, reflected by
      polished fire-irons. The oak desk was dark and old and altogether perfect;
      the chairs were gently supercilious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eathorne's inquiries as to the healths of Mrs. Babbitt, Miss Babbitt, and
      the Other Children were softly paternal, but Babbitt had nothing with
      which to answer him. It was indecent to think of using the &ldquo;How's tricks,
      ole socks?&rdquo; which gratified Vergil Gunch and Frink and Howard Littlefield&mdash;men
      who till now had seemed successful and urbane. Babbitt and Frink sat
      politely, and politely did Eathorne observe, opening his thin lips just
      wide enough to dismiss the words, &ldquo;Gentlemen, before we begin our
      conference&mdash;you may have felt the cold in coming here&mdash;so good
      of you to save an old man the journey&mdash;shall we perhaps have a whisky
      toddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So well trained was Babbitt in all the conversation that befits a Good
      Fellow that he almost disgraced himself with &ldquo;Rather than make trouble,
      and always providin' there ain't any enforcement officers hiding in the
      waste-basket&mdash;&rdquo; The words died choking in his throat. He bowed in
      flustered obedience. So did Chum Frink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eathorne rang for the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern and luxurious Babbitt had never seen any one ring for a servant
      in a private house, except during meals. Himself, in hotels, had rung for
      bell-boys, but in the house you didn't hurt Matilda's feelings; you went
      out in the hall and shouted for her. Nor had he, since prohibition, known
      any one to be casual about drinking. It was extraordinary merely to sip
      his toddy and not cry, &ldquo;Oh, maaaaan, this hits me right where I live!&rdquo; And
      always, with the ecstasy of youth meeting greatness, he marveled, &ldquo;That
      little fuzzy-face there, why, he could make me or break me! If he told my
      banker to call my loans&mdash;! Gosh! That quarter-sized squirt! And
      looking like he hadn't got a single bit of hustle to him! I wonder&mdash;Do
      we Boosters throw too many fits about pep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this thought he shuddered away, and listened devoutly to Eathorne's
      ideas on the advancement of the Sunday School, which were very clear and
      very bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diffidently Babbitt outlined his own suggestions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think if you analyze the needs of the school, in fact, going right at
      it as if it was a merchandizing problem, of course the one basic and
      fundamental need is growth. I presume we're all agreed we won't be
      satisfied till we build up the biggest darn Sunday School in the whole
      state, so the Chatham Road Presbyterian won't have to take anything off
      anybody. Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already
      used contesting teams, and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most
      members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols
      and doodads like poetry books and illustrated Testaments, instead of
      something a real live kid would want to work for, like real cash or a
      speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose it's all fine and dandy
      to illustrate the lessons with these decorated book-marks and blackboard
      drawings and so on, but when it comes down to real he-hustling, getting
      out and drumming up customers&mdash;or members, I mean, why, you got to
      make it worth a fellow's while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I want to propose two stunts: First, divide the Sunday School into
      four armies, depending on age. Everybody gets a military rank in his own
      army according to how many members he brings in, and the duffers that lie
      down on us and don't bring in any, they remain privates. The pastor and
      superintendent rank as generals. And everybody has got to give salutes and
      all the rest of that junk, just like a regular army, to make 'em feel it's
      worth while to get rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, second: Course the school has its advertising committee, but, Lord,
      nobody ever really works good&mdash;nobody works well just for the love of
      it. The thing to do is to be practical and up-to-date, and hire a real
      paid press-agent for the Sunday School-some newspaper fellow who can give
      part of his time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, you bet!&rdquo; said Chum Frink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the nice juicy bits he could get in!&rdquo; Babbitt crowed. &ldquo;Not only
      the big, salient, vital facts, about how fast the Sunday School&mdash;and
      the collection&mdash;is growing, but a lot of humorous gossip and kidding:
      about how some blowhard fell down on his pledge to get new members, or the
      good time the Sacred Trinity class of girls had at their wieniewurst
      party. And on the side, if he had time, the press-agent might even boost
      the lessons themselves&mdash;do a little advertising for all the Sunday
      Schools in town, in fact. No use being hoggish toward the rest of 'em,
      providing we can keep the bulge on 'em in membership. Frinstance, he might
      get the papers to&mdash;Course I haven't got a literary training like
      Frink here, and I'm just guessing how the pieces ought to be written, but
      take frinstance, suppose the week's lesson is about Jacob; well, the
      press-agent might get in something that would have a fine moral, and yet
      with a trick headline that'd get folks to read it&mdash;say like: 'Jake
      Fools the Old Man; Makes Getaway with Girl and Bankroll.' See how I mean?
      That'd get their interest! Now, course, Mr. Eathorne, you're conservative,
      and maybe you feel these stunts would be undignified, but honestly, I
      believe they'd bring home the bacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eathorne folded his hands on his comfortable little belly and purred like
      an aged pussy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I say, first, that I have been very much pleased by your analysis of
      the situation, Mr. Babbitt. As you surmise, it's necessary in My Position
      to be conservative, and perhaps endeavor to maintain a certain standard of
      dignity. Yet I think you'll find me somewhat progressive. In our bank, for
      example, I hope I may say that we have as modern a method of publicity and
      advertising as any in the city. Yes, I fancy you'll find us oldsters quite
      cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the age. Yes, oh yes. And
      so, in fact, it pleases me to be able to say that though personally I
      might prefer the sterner Presbyterianism of an earlier era&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt finally gathered that Eathorne was willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chum Frink suggested as part-time press-agent one Kenneth Escott, reporter
      on the Advocate-Times.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted on a high plane of amity and Christian helpfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt did not drive home, but toward the center of the city. He wished
      to be by himself and exult over the beauty of intimacy with William
      Washington Eathorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      A snow-blanched evening of ringing pavements and eager lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great golden lights of trolley-cars sliding along the packed snow of the
      roadway. Demure lights of little houses. The belching glare of a distant
      foundry, wiping out the sharp-edged stars. Lights of neighborhood drug
      stores where friends gossiped, well pleased, after the day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green light of a police-station, and greener radiance on the snow; the
      drama of a patrol-wagon&mdash;gong beating like a terrified heart,
      headlights scorching the crystal-sparkling street, driver not a chauffeur
      but a policeman proud in uniform, another policeman perilously dangling on
      the step at the back, and a glimpse of the prisoner. A murderer, a
      burglar, a coiner cleverly trapped?
    </p>
    <p>
      An enormous graystone church with a rigid spire; dim light in the Parlors,
      and cheerful droning of choir-practise. The quivering green mercury-vapor
      light of a photo-engraver's loft. Then the storming lights of down-town;
      parked cars with ruby tail-lights; white arched entrances to movie
      theaters, like frosty mouths of winter caves; electric signs&mdash;serpents
      and little dancing men of fire; pink-shaded globes and scarlet jazz music
      in a cheap up-stairs dance-hall; lights of Chinese restaurants, lanterns
      painted with cherry-blossoms and with pagodas, hung against lattices of
      lustrous gold and black. Small dirty lamps in small stinking lunchrooms.
      The smart shopping-district, with rich and quiet light on crystal pendants
      and furs and suave surfaces of polished wood in velvet-hung reticent
      windows. High above the street, an unexpected square hanging in the
      darkness, the window of an office where some one was working late, for a
      reason unknown and stimulating. A man meshed in bankruptcy, an ambitious
      boy, an oil-man suddenly become rich?
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was shrewd, the snow was deep in uncleared alleys, and beyond the
      city, Babbitt knew, were hillsides of snow-drift among wintry oaks, and
      the curving ice-enchanted river.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved his city with passionate wonder. He lost the accumulated
      weariness of business&mdash;worry and expansive oratory; he felt young and
      potential. He was ambitious. It was not enough to be a Vergil Gunch, an
      Orville Jones. No. &ldquo;They're bully fellows, simply lovely, but they haven't
      got any finesse.&rdquo; No. He was going to be an Eathorne; delicately rigorous,
      coldly powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the stuff. The wallop in the velvet mitt. Not let anybody get
      fresh with you. Been getting careless about my diction. Slang. Colloquial.
      Cut it out. I was first-rate at rhetoric in college. Themes on&mdash;Anyway,
      not bad. Had too much of this hooptedoodle and good-fellow stuff. I&mdash;Why
      couldn't I organize a bank of my own some day? And Ted succeed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove happily home, and to Mrs. Babbitt he was a William Washington
      Eathorne, but she did not notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Kenneth Escott, reporter on the Advocate-Times was appointed
      press-agent of the Chatham Road Presbyterian Sunday School. He gave six
      hours a week to it. At least he was paid for giving six hours a week. He
      had friends on the Press and the Gazette and he was not (officially) known
      as a press-agent. He procured a trickle of insinuating items about
      neighborliness and the Bible, about class-suppers, jolly but educational,
      and the value of the Prayer-life in attaining financial success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday School adopted Babbitt's system of military ranks. Quickened by
      this spiritual refreshment, it had a boom. It did not become the largest
      school in Zenith&mdash;the Central Methodist Church kept ahead of it by
      methods which Dr. Drew scored as &ldquo;unfair, undignified, un-American,
      ungentlemanly, and unchristian&rdquo;&mdash;but it climbed from fourth place to
      second, and there was rejoicing in heaven, or at least in that portion of
      heaven included in the parsonage of Dr. Drew, while Babbitt had much
      praise and good repute.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school. He
      was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys; his
      ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called &ldquo;Colonel;&rdquo;
       and if he did not attend Sunday School merely to be thus exalted,
      certainly he thought about it all the way there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was particularly pleasant to the press-agent, Kenneth Escott; he took
      him to lunch at the Athletic Club and had him at the house for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many of the cocksure young men who forage about cities in apparent
      contentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang, Escott
      was shy and lonely. His shrewd starveling face broadened with joy at
      dinner, and he blurted, &ldquo;Gee whillikins, Mrs. Babbitt, if you knew how
      good it is to have home eats again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Escott and Verona liked each other. All evening they &ldquo;talked about ideas.&rdquo;
       They discovered that they were Radicals. True, they were sensible about
      it. They agreed that all communists were criminals; that this vers libre
      was tommy-rot; and that while there ought to be universal disarmament, of
      course Great Britain and the United States must, on behalf of oppressed
      small nations, keep a navy equal to the tonnage of all the rest of the
      world. But they were so revolutionary that they predicted (to Babbitt's
      irritation) that there would some day be a Third Party which would give
      trouble to the Republicans and Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escott shook hands with Babbitt three times, at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt mentioned his extreme fondness for Eathorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week three newspapers presented accounts of Babbitt's sterling
      labors for religion, and all of them tactfully mentioned William
      Washington Eathorne as his collaborator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had brought Babbitt quite so much credit at the Elks, the Athletic
      Club, and the Boosters'. His friends had always congratulated him on his
      oratory, but in their praise was doubt, for even in speeches advertising
      the city there was something highbrow and degenerate, like writing poetry.
      But now Orville Jones shouted across the Athletic dining-room, &ldquo;Here's the
      new director of the First State Bank!&rdquo; Grover Butterbaugh, the eminent
      wholesaler of plumbers' supplies, chuckled, &ldquo;Wonder you mix with common
      folks, after holding Eathorne's hand!&rdquo; And Emil Wengert, the jeweler, was
      at last willing to discuss buying a house in Dorchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Sunday School campaign was finished, Babbitt suggested to Kenneth
      Escott, &ldquo;Say, how about doing a little boosting for Doc Drew personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Escott grinned. &ldquo;You trust the doc to do a little boosting for himself,
      Mr. Babbitt! There's hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the
      paper to say if we'll chase a reporter up to his Study, he'll let us in on
      the story about the swell sermon he's going to preach on the wickedness of
      short skirts, or the authorship of the Pentateuch. Don't you worry about
      him. There's just one better publicity-grabber in town, and that's this
      Dora Gibson Tucker that runs the Child Welfare and the Americanization
      League, and the only reason she's got Drew beaten is because she has got
      SOME brains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now Kenneth, I don't think you ought to talk that way about the
      doctor. A preacher has to watch his interests, hasn't he? You remember
      that in the Bible about&mdash;about being diligent in the Lord's business,
      or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll get something in if you want me to, Mr. Babbitt, but I'll
      have to wait till the managing editor is out of town, and then blackjack
      the city editor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to pass that in the Sunday Advocate-Times, under a picture of
      Dr. Drew at his earnestest, with eyes alert, jaw as granite, and rustic
      lock flamboyant, appeared an inscription&mdash;a wood-pulp tablet
      conferring twenty-four hours' immortality:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew, M.A., pastor of the beautiful Chatham
      Road Presbyterian Church in lovely Floral Heights, is a wizard
      soul-winner. He holds the local record for conversions. During his
      shepherdhood an average of almost a hundred sin-weary persons per year
      have declared their resolve to lead a new life and have found a harbor of
      refuge and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything zips at the Chatham Road Church. The subsidiary organizations
      are keyed to the top-notch of efficiency. Dr. Drew is especially keen on
      good congregational singing. Bright cheerful hymns are used at every
      meeting, and the special Sing Services attract lovers of music and
      professionals from all parts of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the popular lecture platform as well as in the pulpit Dr. Drew is a
      renowned word-painter, and during the course of the year he receives
      literally scores of invitations to speak at varied functions both here and
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt let Dr. Drew know that he was responsible for this tribute. Dr.
      Drew called him &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; and shook his hand a great many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the meetings of the Advisory Committee, Babbitt had hinted that he
      would be charmed to invite Eathorne to dinner, but Eathorne had murmured,
      &ldquo;So nice of you&mdash;old man, now&mdash;almost never go out.&rdquo; Surely
      Eathorne would not refuse his own pastor. Babbitt said boyishly to Drew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, doctor, now we've put this thing over, strikes me it's up to the
      dominie to blow the three of us to a dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully! You bet! Delighted!&rdquo; cried Dr. Drew, in his manliest way. (Some
      one had once told him that he talked like the late President Roosevelt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, uh, say, doctor, be sure and get Mr. Eathorne to come. Insist on it.
      It's, uh&mdash;I think he sticks around home too much for his own health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eathorne came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a friendly dinner. Babbitt spoke gracefully of the stabilizing and
      educational value of bankers to the community. They were, he said, the
      pastors of the fold of commerce. For the first time Eathorne departed from
      the topic of Sunday Schools, and asked Babbitt about the progress of his
      business. Babbitt answered modestly, almost filially.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later, when he had a chance to take part in the Street
      Traction Company's terminal deal, Babbitt did not care to go to his own
      bank for a loan. It was rather a quiet sort of deal and, if it had come
      out, the Public might not have understood. He went to his friend Mr.
      Eathorne; he was welcomed, and received the loan as a private venture; and
      they both profited in their pleasant new association.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Babbitt went to church regularly, except on spring Sunday
      mornings which were obviously meant for motoring. He announced to Ted, &ldquo;I
      tell you, boy, there's no stronger bulwark of sound conservatism than the
      evangelical church, and no better place to make friends who'll help you to
      gain your rightful place in the community than in your own church-home!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THOUGH he saw them twice daily, though he knew and amply discussed every
      detail of their expenditures, yet for weeks together Babbitt was no more
      conscious of his children than of the buttons on his coat-sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admiration of Kenneth Escott made him aware of Verona.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had become secretary to Mr. Gruensberg of the Gruensberg Leather
      Company; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres
      details and never quite understands them; but she was one of the people
      who give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing something
      desperate&mdash;of leaving a job or a husband&mdash;without ever doing it.
      Babbitt was so hopeful about Escott's hesitant ardors that he became the
      playful parent. When he returned from the Elks he peered coyly into the
      living-room and gurgled, &ldquo;Has our Kenny been here to-night?&rdquo; He never
      credited Verona's protest, &ldquo;Why, Ken and I are just good friends, and we
      only talk about Ideas. I won't have all this sentimental nonsense, that
      would spoil everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Ted who most worried Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With conditions in Latin and English but with a triumphant record in
      manual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, Ted was
      struggling through his Senior year in the East Side High School. At home
      he was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the
      ignition system of the car. He repeated to his tut-tutting father that he
      did not wish to go to college or law-school, and Babbitt was equally
      disturbed by this &ldquo;shiftlessness&rdquo; and by Ted's relations with Eunice
      Littlefield, next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she was the daughter of Howard Littlefield, that wrought-iron
      fact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, Eunice was a
      midge in the sun. She danced into the house, she flung herself into
      Babbitt's lap when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed at
      him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper as he
      hated a broken sales-contract. She was seventeen now. Her ambition was to
      be a cinema actress. She did not merely attend the showing of every
      &ldquo;feature film;&rdquo; she also read the motion-picture magazines, those
      extraordinary symptoms of the Age of Pep&mdash;monthlies and weeklies gorgeously
      illustrated with portraits of young women who had recently been manicure
      girls, not very skilful manicure girls, and who, unless their every
      grimace had been arranged by a director, could not have acted in the
      Easter cantata of the Central Methodist Church; magazines reporting, quite
      seriously, in &ldquo;interviews&rdquo; plastered with pictures of riding-breeches and
      California bungalows, the views on sculpture and international politics of
      blankly beautiful, suspiciously beautiful young men; outlining the plots
      of films about pure prostitutes and kind-hearted train-robbers; and giving
      directions for making bootblacks into Celebrated Scenario Authors
      overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      These authorities Eunice studied. She could, she frequently did, tell
      whether it was in November or December, 1905, that Mack Harker? the
      renowned screen cowpuncher and badman, began his public career as chorus
      man in &ldquo;Oh, You Naughty Girlie.&rdquo; On the wall of her room, her father
      reported, she had pinned up twenty-one photographs of actors. But the
      signed portrait of the most graceful of the movie heroes she carried in
      her young bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was bewildered by this worship of new gods, and he suspected that
      Eunice smoked cigarettes. He smelled the cloying reek from up-stairs, and
      heard her giggling with Ted. He never inquired. The agreeable child
      dismayed him. Her thin and charming face was sharpened by bobbed hair; her
      skirts were short, her stockings were rolled, and, as she flew after Ted,
      above the caressing silk were glimpses of soft knees which made Babbitt
      uneasy, and wretched that she should consider him old. Sometimes, in the
      veiled life of his dreams, when the fairy child came running to him she
      took on the semblance of Eunice Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted was motor-mad as Eunice was movie-mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand sarcastic refusals did not check his teasing for a car of his
      own. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil,
      he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic
      Ford chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went
      skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit.
      Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven
      sandwiches and a bottle of Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched
      eerily on the rumble seat, he went roaring off to distant towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually Eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums, and quarreled with a
      wholesome and violent lack of delicacy; but now and then, after the color
      and scent of a dance, they were silent together and a little furtive, and
      Babbitt was worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was an average father. He was affectionate, bullying, opinionated,
      ignorant, and rather wistful. Like most parents, he enjoyed the game of
      waiting till the victim was clearly wrong, then virtuously pouncing. He
      justified himself by croaking, &ldquo;Well, Ted's mother spoils him. Got to be
      somebody who tells him what's what, and me, I'm elected the goat. Because
      I try to bring him up to be a real, decent, human being and not one of
      these sapheads and lounge-lizards, of course they all call me a grouch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, with the eternal human genius for arriving by the worst
      possible routes at surprisingly tolerable goals, Babbitt loved his son and
      warmed to his companionship and would have sacrificed everything for him&mdash;if
      he could have been sure of proper credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted was planning a party for his set in the Senior Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt meant to be helpful and jolly about it. From his memory of
      high-school pleasures back in Catawba he suggested the nicest games: Going
      to Boston, and charades with stew-pans for helmets, and word-games in
      which you were an Adjective or a Quality. When he was most enthusiastic he
      discovered that they weren't paying attention; they were only tolerating
      him. As for the party, it was as fixed and standardized as a Union Club
      Hop. There was to be dancing in the living-room, a noble collation in the
      dining-room, and in the hall two tables of bridge for what Ted called &ldquo;the
      poor old dumb-bells that you can't get to dance hardly more 'n half the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every breakfast was monopolized by conferences on the affair. No one
      listened to Babbitt's bulletins about the February weather or to his
      throat-clearing comments on the headlines. He said furiously, &ldquo;If I may be
      PERMITTED to interrupt your engrossing private CONVERSATION&mdash;Juh hear
      what I SAID?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't be a spoiled baby! Ted and I have just as much right to talk as
      you have!&rdquo; flared Mrs. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the party he was permitted to look on, when he was not
      helping Matilda with the Vecchia ice cream and the petits fours. He was
      deeply disquieted. Eight years ago, when Verona had given a high-school
      party, the children had been featureless gabies. Now they were men and
      women of the world, very supercilious men and women; the boys condescended
      to Babbitt, they wore evening-clothes, and with hauteur they accepted
      cigarettes from silver cases. Babbitt had heard stories of what the
      Athletic Club called &ldquo;goings on&rdquo; at young parties; of girls &ldquo;parking&rdquo;
       their corsets in the dressing-room, of &ldquo;cuddling&rdquo; and &ldquo;petting,&rdquo; and a
      presumable increase in what was known as Immorality. To-night he believed
      the stories. These children seemed bold to him, and cold. The girls wore
      misty chiffon, coral velvet, or cloth of gold, and around their dipping
      bobbed hair were shining wreaths. He had it, upon urgent and secret
      inquiry, that no corsets were known to be parked upstairs; but certainly
      these eager bodies were not stiff with steel. Their stockings were of
      lustrous silk, their slippers costly and unnatural, their lips carmined
      and their eyebrows penciled. They danced cheek to cheek with the boys, and
      Babbitt sickened with apprehension and unconscious envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worst of them all was Eunice Littlefield, and maddest of all the boys was
      Ted. Eunice was a flying demon. She slid the length of the room; her
      tender shoulders swayed; her feet were deft as a weaver's shuttle; she
      laughed, and enticed Babbitt to dance with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he discovered the annex to the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys and girls disappeared occasionally, and he remembered rumors of
      their drinking together from hip-pocket flasks. He tiptoed round the
      house, and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the
      points of light from cigarettes, from each of them heard high giggles. He
      wanted to denounce them but (standing in the snow, peering round the dark
      corner) he did not dare. He tried to be tactful. When he had returned to
      the front hall he coaxed the boys, &ldquo;Say, if any of you fellows are
      thirsty, there's some dandy ginger ale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Thanks!&rdquo; they condescended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, &ldquo;I'd like to go in there
      and throw some of those young pups out of the house! They talk down to me
      like I was the butler! I'd like to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she sighed; &ldquo;only everybody says, all the mothers tell me,
      unless you stand for them, if you get angry because they go out to their
      cars to have a drink, they won't come to your house any more, and we
      wouldn't want Ted left out of things, would we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He announced that he would be enchanted to have Ted left out of things,
      and hurried in to be polite, lest Ted be left out of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, he resolved, if he found that the boys were drinking, he would&mdash;well,
      he'd &ldquo;hand 'em something that would surprise 'em.&rdquo; While he was trying to
      be agreeable to large-shouldered young bullies he was earnestly sniffing
      at them. Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it
      was only twice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and
      Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He
      called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained
      to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went
      off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. &ldquo;That little devil!
      Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag,
      acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough
      Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences.
      Babbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and
      Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several months there was coolness between the Babbitts and the
      Littlefields, each family sheltering their lamb from the wolf-cub next
      door. Babbitt and Littlefield still spoke in pontifical periods about
      motors and the senate, but they kept bleakly away from mention of their
      families. Whenever Eunice came to the house she discussed with pleasant
      intimacy the fact that she had been forbidden to come to the house; and
      Babbitt tried, with no success whatever, to be fatherly and advisory with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh all fishhooks!&rdquo; Ted wailed to Eunice, as they wolfed hot chocolate,
      lumps of nougat, and an assortment of glace nuts, in the mosaic splendor
      of the Royal Drug Store, &ldquo;it gets me why Dad doesn't just pass out from
      being so poky. Every evening he sits there, about half-asleep, and if Rone
      or I say, 'Oh, come on, let's do something,' he doesn't even take the
      trouble to think about it. He just yawns and says, 'Naw, this suits me
      right here.' He doesn't know there's any fun going on anywhere. I suppose
      he must do some thinking, same as you and I do, but gosh, there's no way
      of telling it. I don't believe that outside of the office and playing a
      little bum golf on Saturday he knows there's anything in the world to do
      except just keep sitting there&mdash;sitting there every night&mdash;not wanting
      to go anywhere&mdash;not wanting to do anything&mdash;thinking us kids are
      crazy&mdash;sitting there&mdash;Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was frightened by Ted's slackness, Babbitt was not sufficiently
      frightened by Verona. She was too safe. She lived too much in the neat
      little airless room of her mind. Kenneth Escott and she were always under
      foot. When they were not at home, conducting their cautiously radical
      courtship over sheets of statistics, they were trudging off to lectures by
      authors and Hindu philosophers and Swedish lieutenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh,&rdquo; Babbitt wailed to his wife, as they walked home from the Fogartys'
      bridge-party, &ldquo;it gets me how Rone and that fellow can be so poky. They
      sit there night after night, whenever he isn't working, and they don't
      know there's any fun in the world. All talk and discussion&mdash;Lord!
      Sitting there&mdash;sitting there&mdash;night after night&mdash;not
      wanting to do anything&mdash;thinking I'm crazy because I like to go out
      and play a fist of cards&mdash;sitting there&mdash;gosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then round the swimmer, bored by struggling through the perpetual surf of
      family life, new combers swelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's father- and mother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Thompson,
      rented their old house in the Bellevue district and moved to the Hotel
      Hatton, that glorified boarding-house filled with widows, red-plush
      furniture, and the sound of ice-water pitchers. They were lonely there,
      and every other Sunday evening the Babbitts had to dine with them, on
      fricasseed chicken, discouraged celery, and cornstarch ice cream, and
      afterward sit, polite and restrained, in the hotel lounge, while a young
      woman violinist played songs from the German via Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Babbitt's own mother came down from Catawba to spend three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a kind woman and magnificently uncomprehending. She congratulated
      the convention-defying Verona on being a &ldquo;nice, loyal home-body without
      all these Ideas that so many girls seem to have nowadays;&rdquo; and when Ted
      filled the differential with grease, out of pure love of mechanics and
      filthiness, she rejoiced that he was &ldquo;so handy around the house&mdash;and
      helping his father and all, and not going out with the girls all the time
      and trying to pretend he was a society fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt loved his mother, and sometimes he rather liked her, but he was
      annoyed by her Christian Patience, and he was reduced to pulpiness when
      she discoursed about a quite mythical hero called &ldquo;Your Father&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't remember it, Georgie, you were such a little fellow at the time&mdash;my,
      I remember just how you looked that day, with your goldy brown curls and
      your lace collar, you always were such a dainty child, and kind of puny
      and sickly, and you loved pretty things so much and the red tassels on
      your little bootees and all&mdash;and Your Father was taking us to church
      and a man stopped us and said 'Major'&mdash;so many of the neighbors used
      to call Your Father 'Major;' of course he was only a private in The War
      but everybody knew that was because of the jealousy of his captain and he
      ought to have been a high-ranking officer, he had that natural ability to
      command that so very, very few men have&mdash;and this man came out into
      the road and held up his hand and stopped the buggy and said, 'Major,' he
      said, 'there's a lot of the folks around here that have decided to support
      Colonel Scanell for congress, and we want you to join us. Meeting people
      the way you do in the store, you could help us a lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Your Father just looked at him and said, 'I certainly shall do
      nothing of the sort. I don't like his politics,' he said. Well, the man&mdash;Captain
      Smith they used to call him, and heaven only knows why, because he hadn't
      the shadow or vestige of a right to be called 'Captain' or any other title&mdash;this
      Captain Smith said, 'We'll make it hot for you if you don't stick by your
      friends, Major.' Well, you know how Your Father was, and this Smith knew
      it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your Father knew the
      political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen that here was
      one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and hinting and
      trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain Smith,' he
      said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply
      qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!' and
      with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like
      a bump on a log!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the
      children. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the
      &ldquo;loveliest little pink bow in his curls&rdquo; and corrupted his own name to
      &ldquo;Goo-goo.&rdquo; He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing
      Tinka, &ldquo;Come on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat
      it down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came down
      from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty
      general-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of
      the good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly, and
      disagreeable. His favorite remark was &ldquo;How much did you pay for that?&rdquo; He
      regarded Verona's books, Babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers on the table
      as citified extravagances, and said so. Babbitt would have quarreled with
      him but for his gawky wife and the baby, whom Babbitt teased and poked
      fingers at and addressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this baby's a bum, yes, sir, I think this little baby's a bum,
      he's a bum, yes, sir, he's a bum, that's what he is, he's a bum, this
      baby's a bum, he's nothing but an old bum, that's what he is&mdash;a bum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the while Verona and Kenneth Escott held long inquiries into
      epistemology; Ted was a disgraced rebel; and Tinka, aged eleven, was
      demanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week, &ldquo;like all
      the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt raged, &ldquo;I'm sick of it! Having to carry three generations. Whole
      damn bunch lean on me. Pay half of mother's income, listen to Henry T.,
      listen to Myra's worrying, be polite to Mart, and get called an old grouch
      for trying to help the children. All of 'em depending on me and picking on
      me and not a damn one of 'em grateful! No relief, and no credit, and no
      help from anybody. And to keep it up for&mdash;good Lord, how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He enjoyed being sick in February; he was delighted by their consternation
      that he, the rock, should give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had eaten a questionable clam. For two days he was languorous and
      petted and esteemed. He was allowed to snarl &ldquo;Oh, let me alone!&rdquo; without
      reprisals. He lay on the sleeping-porch and watched the winter sun slide
      along the taut curtains, turning their ruddy khaki to pale blood red. The
      shadow of the draw-rope was dense black, in an enticing ripple on the
      canvas. He found pleasure in the curve of it, sighed as the fading light
      blurred it. He was conscious of life, and a little sad. With no Vergil
      Gunches before whom to set his face in resolute optimism, he beheld, and
      half admitted that he beheld, his way of life as incredibly mechanical.
      Mechanical business&mdash;a brisk selling of badly built houses.
      Mechanical religion&mdash;a dry, hard church, shut off from the real life
      of the streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. Mechanical golf and
      dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. Save with Paul Riesling,
      mechanical friendships&mdash;back-slapping and jocular, never daring to
      essay the test of quietness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned uneasily in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet
      afternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle
      pretentiousness. He thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men
      he hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms&mdash;hat
      on knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't hardly want to go back to work,&rdquo; he prayed. &ldquo;I'd like to&mdash;I
      don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was back next day, busy and of doubtful temper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE Zenith Street Traction Company planned to build car-repair shops in
      the suburb of Dorchester, but when they came to buy the land they found it
      held, on options, by the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. The
      purchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of the
      Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned their
      duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts, though
      somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the officials
      found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of the
      correspondence are in the company's files, where they may be viewed by any
      public commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank, the
      purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five thousand
      dollar car, the first vice-president built a home in Devon Woods, and the
      president was appointed minister to a foreign country.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain the options, to tie up one man's land without letting his
      neighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary to
      introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend that he
      wasn't taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a
      poker-player at a time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened his
      whole plan. To all this was added a nerve-jabbing quarrel with his secret
      associates in the deal. They did not wish Babbitt and Thompson to have any
      share in the deal except as brokers. Babbitt rather agreed. &ldquo;Ethics of the
      business-broker ought to strictly represent his principles and not get in
      on the buying,&rdquo; he said to Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethics, rats! Think I'm going to see that bunch of holy grafters get away
      with the swag and us not climb in?&rdquo; snorted old Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't like to do it. Kind of double-crossing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't. It's triple-crossing. It's the public that gets double-crossed.
      Well, now we've been ethical and got it out of our systems, the question
      is where we can raise a loan to handle some of the property for ourselves,
      on the Q. T. We can't go to our bank for it. Might come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could see old Eathorne. He's close as the tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eathorne was glad, he said, to &ldquo;invest in character,&rdquo; to make Babbitt the
      loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the bank.
      Thus certain of the options which Babbitt and Thompson obtained were on
      parcels of real estate which they themselves owned, though the property
      did not appear in their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of closing this splendid deal, which stimulated business and
      public confidence by giving an example of increased real-estate activity,
      Babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person working for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dishonest one was Stanley Graff, the outside salesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Babbitt had been worried about Graff. He did not keep his
      word to tenants. In order to rent a house he would promise repairs which
      the owner had not authorized. It was suspected that he juggled inventories
      of furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had to pay for
      articles which had never been in the house and the price of which Graff
      put into his pocket. Babbitt had not been able to prove these suspicions,
      and though he had rather planned to discharge Graff he had never quite
      found time for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now into Babbitt's private room charged a red-faced man, panting, &ldquo;Look
      here! I've come to raise particular merry hell, and unless you have that
      fellow pinched, I will!&rdquo; &ldquo;What's&mdash;Calm down, o' man. What's trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble! Huh! Here's the trouble&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and take it easy! They can hear you all over the building!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow Graff you got working for you, he leases me a house. I was in
      yesterday and signs the lease, all O.K., and he was to get the owner's
      signature and mail me the lease last night. Well, and he did. This morning
      I comes down to breakfast and the girl says a fellow had come to the house
      right after the early delivery and told her he wanted an envelope that had
      been mailed by mistake, big long envelope with 'Babbitt-Thompson' in the
      corner of it. Sure enough, there it was, so she lets him have it. And she
      describes the fellow to me, and it was this Graff. So I 'phones to him and
      he, the poor fool, he admits it! He says after my lease was all signed he
      got a better offer from another fellow and he wanted my lease back. Now
      what you going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Varney&mdash;W. K. Varney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. That was the Garrison house.&rdquo; Babbitt sounded the buzzer. When
      Miss McGoun came in, he demanded, &ldquo;Graff gone out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to
      Mr. Varney on the Garrison house?&rdquo; To Varney: &ldquo;Can't tell you how sorry I
      am this happened. Needless to say, I'll fire Graff the minute he comes in.
      And of course your lease stands. But there's one other thing I'd like to
      do. I'll tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply it to your
      rent. No! Straight! I want to. To be frank, this thing shakes me up bad. I
      suppose I've always been a Practical Business Man. Probably I've told one
      or two fairy stories in my time, when the occasion called for it&mdash;you
      know: sometimes you have to lay things on thick, to impress boneheads. But
      this is the first time I've ever had to accuse one of my own employees of
      anything more dishonest than pinching a few stamps. Honest, it would hurt
      me if we profited by it. So you'll let me hand you the commission? Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked through the February city, where trucks flung up a spattering of
      slush and the sky was dark above dark brick cornices. He came back
      miserable. He, who respected the law, had broken it by concealing the
      Federal crime of interception of the mails. But he could not see Graff go
      to jail and his wife suffer. Worse, he had to discharge Graff and this was
      a part of office routine which he feared. He liked people so much, he so
      much wanted them to like him that he could not bear insulting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss McGoun dashed in to whisper, with the excitement of an approaching
      scene, &ldquo;He's here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Graff? Ask him to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to make himself heavy and calm in his chair, and to keep his eyes
      expressionless. Graff stalked in&mdash;a man of thirty-five, dapper,
      eye-glassed, with a foppish mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want me?&rdquo; said Graff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Graff continued to stand, grunting, &ldquo;I suppose that old nut Varney has
      been in to see you. Let me explain about him. He's a regular tightwad, and
      he sticks out for every cent, and he practically lied to me about his
      ability to pay the rent&mdash;I found that out just after we signed up.
      And then another fellow comes along with a better offer for the house, and
      I felt it was my duty to the firm to get rid of Varney, and I was so
      worried about it I skun up there and got back the lease. Honest, Mr.
      Babbitt, I didn't intend to pull anything crooked. I just wanted the firm
      to have all the commis&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait now, Stan. This may all be true, but I've been having a lot of
      complaints about you. Now I don't s'pose you ever mean to do wrong, and I
      think if you just get a good lesson that'll jog you up a little, you'll
      turn out a first-class realtor yet. But I don't see how I can keep you
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Graff leaned against the filing-cabinet, his hands in his pockets, and
      laughed. &ldquo;So I'm fired! Well, old Vision and Ethics, I'm tickled to death!
      But I don't want you to think you can get away with any holier-than-thou
      stuff. Sure I've pulled some raw stuff&mdash;a little of it&mdash;but how
      could I help it, in this office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by God, young man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut! Keep the naughty temper down, and don't holler, because
      everybody in the outside office will hear you. They're probably listening
      right now. Babbitt, old dear, you're crooked in the first place and a damn
      skinflint in the second. If you paid me a decent salary I wouldn't have to
      steal pennies off a blind man to keep my wife from starving. Us married
      just five months, and her the nicest girl living, and you keeping us flat
      broke all the time, you damned old thief, so you can put money away for
      your saphead of a son and your wishywashy fool of a daughter! Wait, now!
      You'll by God take it, or I'll bellow so the whole office will hear it!
      And crooked&mdash;Say, if I told the prosecuting attorney what I know
      about this last Street Traction option steal, both you and me would go to
      jail, along with some nice, clean, pious, high-up traction guns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Stan, looks like we were coming down to cases. That deal&mdash;There
      was nothing crooked about it. The only way you can get progress is for the
      broad-gauged men to get things done; and they got to be rewarded&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Pete's sake, don't get virtuous on me! As I gather it, I'm fired.
      All right. It's a good thing for me. And if I catch you knocking me to any
      other firm, I'll squeal all I know about you and Henry T. and the dirty
      little lickspittle deals that you corporals of industry pull off for the
      bigger and brainier crooks, and you'll get chased out of town. And me&mdash;you're
      right, Babbitt, I've been going crooked, but now I'm going straight, and
      the first step will be to get a job in some office where the boss doesn't
      talk about Ideals. Bad luck, old dear, and you can stick your job up the
      sewer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt sat for a long time, alternately raging, &ldquo;I'll have him arrested,&rdquo;
       and yearning &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;No, I've never done anything that wasn't
      necessary to keep the Wheels of Progress moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day he hired in Graff's place Fritz Weilinger, the salesman of his
      most injurious rival, the East Side Homes and Development Company, and
      thus at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man. Young
      Fritz was a curly-headed, merry, tennis-playing youngster. He made
      customers welcome to the office. Babbitt thought of him as a son, and in
      him had much comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      An abandoned race-track on the outskirts of Chicago, a plot excellent for
      factory sites, was to be sold, and Jake Offut asked Babbitt to bid on it
      for him. The strain of the Street Traction deal and his disappointment in
      Stanley Graff had so shaken Babbitt that he found it hard to sit at his
      desk and concentrate. He proposed to his family, &ldquo;Look here, folks! Do you
      know who's going to trot up to Chicago for a couple of days&mdash;just
      week-end; won't lose but one day of school&mdash;know who's going with
      that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt? Why, Mr. Theodore
      Roosevelt Babbitt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; Ted shouted, and &ldquo;Oh, maybe the Babbitt men won't paint that lil
      ole town red!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, once away from the familiar implications of home, they were two men
      together. Ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only
      realms, apparently, in which Babbitt had a larger and more grown-up
      knowledge than Ted's were the details of real estate and the phrases of
      politics. When the other sages of the Pullman smoking-compartment had left
      them to themselves, Babbitt's voice did not drop into the playful and
      otherwise offensive tone in which one addresses children but continued its
      overwhelming and monotonous rumble, and Ted tried to imitate it in his
      strident tenor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, dad, you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip about
      the League of Nations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the trouble with a lot of these fellows is, they simply don't know
      what they're talking about. They don't get down to facts.... What do you
      think of Ken Escott?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you, dad: it strikes me Ken is a nice lad; no special faults
      except he smokes too much; but slow, Lord! Why, if we don't give him a
      shove the poor dumb-bell never will propose! And Rone just as bad. Slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess you're right. They're slow. They haven't either one of 'em
      got our pep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right. They're slow. I swear, dad, I don't know how Rone got into
      our family! I'll bet, if the truth were known, you were a bad old egg when
      you were a kid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wasn't so slow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet you weren't! I'll bet you didn't miss many tricks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I was out with the girls I didn't spend all the time telling
      'em about the strike in the knitting industry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They roared together, and together lighted cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do with 'em?&rdquo; Babbitt consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, I don't know. I swear, sometimes I feel like taking Ken aside and
      putting him over the jumps and saying to him, 'Young fella me lad, are you
      going to marry young Rone, or are you going to talk her to death? Here you
      are getting on toward thirty, and you're only making twenty or twenty-five
      a week. When you going to develop a sense of responsibility and get a
      raise? If there's anything that George F. or I can do to help you, call on
      us, but show a little speed, anyway!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at that, it might not be so bad if you or I talked to him, except
      he might not understand. He's one of these high brows. He can't come down
      to cases and lay his cards on the table and talk straight out from the
      shoulder, like you or I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, he's like all these highbrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so, like all of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sighed, and were silent and thoughtful and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor came in. He had once called at Babbitt's office, to ask
      about houses. &ldquo;H' are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going to have you with us to
      Chicago? This your boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is my son Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, what do you know about that! Here I been thinking you were a
      youngster yourself, not a day over forty, hardly, and you with this great
      big fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty? Why, brother, I'll never see forty-five again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a fact! Wouldn't hardly 'a' thought it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, it's a bad give-away for the old man when he has to travel with
      a young whale like Ted here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, it is.&rdquo; To Ted: &ldquo;I suppose you're in college now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Proudly, &ldquo;No, not till next fall. I'm just kind of giving the diff'rent
      colleges the once-over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the conductor went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling
      against his blue chest, Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges. They
      arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning, rejoicing,
      &ldquo;Pretty nice not to have to get up and get down to breakfast, heh?&rdquo; They
      were staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith business men always
      stayed at the Eden, but they had dinner in the brocade and crystal
      Versailles Room of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt ordered Blue Point oysters
      with cocktail sauce, a tremendous steak with a tremendous platter of
      French fried potatoes, two pots of coffee, apple pie with ice cream for
      both of them and, for Ted, an extra piece of mince pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot stuff! Some feed, young fella!&rdquo; Ted admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! You stick around with me, old man, and I'll show you a good time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went to a musical comedy and nudged each other at the matrimonial
      jokes and the prohibition jokes; they paraded the lobby, arm in arm,
      between acts, and in the glee of his first release from the shame which
      dissevers fathers and sons Ted chuckled, &ldquo;Dad, did you ever hear the one
      about the three milliners and the judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Ted had returned to Zenith, Babbitt was lonely. As he was trying to
      make alliance between Offutt and certain Milwaukee interests which wanted
      the race-track plot, most of his time was taken up in waiting for
      telephone calls.... Sitting on the edge of his bed, holding the portable
      telephone, asking wearily, &ldquo;Mr. Sagen not in yet? Didn' he leave any
      message for me? All right, I'll hold the wire.&rdquo; Staring at a stain on the
      wall, reflecting that it resembled a shoe, and being bored by this
      twentieth discovery that it resembled a shoe. Lighting a cigarette; then,
      bound to the telephone with no ashtray in reach, wondering what to do with
      this burning menace and anxiously trying to toss it into the tiled
      bathroom. At last, on the telephone, &ldquo;No message, eh? All right, I'll call
      up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon he wandered through snow-rutted streets of which he had
      never heard, streets of small tenements and two-family houses and marooned
      cottages. It came to him that he had nothing to do, that there was nothing
      he wanted to do. He was bleakly lonely in the evening, when he dined by
      himself at the Regency Hotel. He sat in the lobby afterward, in a plush
      chair bedecked with the Saxe-Coburg arms, lighting a cigar and looking for
      some one who would come and play with him and save him from thinking. In
      the chair next to him (showing the arms of Lithuania) was a half-familiar
      man, a large red-faced man with pop eyes and a deficient yellow mustache.
      He seemed kind and insignificant, and as lonely as Babbitt himself. He
      wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was
      Sir Gerald Doak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively Babbitt rose, bumbling, &ldquo;How 're you, Sir Gerald? 'Member we
      met in Zenith, at Charley McKelvey's? Babbitt's my name&mdash;real
      estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How d' you do.&rdquo; Sir Gerald shook hands flabbily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt maundered,
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw you in Zenith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. British Columbia and California and all over the place,&rdquo; he said
      doubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose
      maybe you didn't look into 'em. Scenery and sport and so on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions&mdash;You know, Mr.
      Babbitt, they're having almost as much unemployment as we are.&rdquo; Sir Gerald
      was speaking warmly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Business conditions not so doggone good, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, business conditions weren't at all what I'd hoped to find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not&mdash;not really good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a darn shame. Well&mdash;I suppose you're waiting for somebody to
      take you out to some big shindig, Sir Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shindig? Oh. Shindig. No, to tell you the truth, I was wondering what the
      deuce I could do this evening. Don't know a soul in Tchicahgo. I wonder if
      you happen to know whether there's a good theater in this city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good? Why say, they're running grand opera right now! I guess maybe you'd
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Eh? Went to the opera once in London. Covent Garden sort of thing.
      Shocking! No, I was wondering if there was a good cinema-movie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was sitting down, hitching his chair over, shouting, &ldquo;Movie? Say,
      Sir Gerald, I supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to lead
      you out to some soiree&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;but if you haven't, what do you say you and me go to a movie?
      There's a peach of a film at the Grantham: Bill Hart in a bandit picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right-o! Just a moment while I get my coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swollen with greatness, slightly afraid lest the noble blood of Nottingham
      change its mind and leave him at any street corner, Babbitt paraded with
      Sir Gerald Doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat beside him,
      trying not to be too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise his adoration
      of six-shooters and broncos. At the end Sir Gerald murmured, &ldquo;Jolly good
      picture, this. So awfully decent of you to take me. Haven't enjoyed myself
      so much for weeks. All these Hostesses&mdash;they never let you go to the
      cinema!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you say!&rdquo; Babbitt's speech had lost the delicate refinement and
      all the broad A's with which he had adorned it, and become hearty and
      natural. &ldquo;Well, I'm tickled to death you liked it, Sir Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crawled past the knees of fat women into the aisle; they stood in the
      lobby waving their arms in the rite of putting on overcoats. Babbitt
      hinted, &ldquo;Say, how about a little something to eat? I know a place where we
      could get a swell rarebit, and we might dig up a little drink&mdash;that
      is, if you ever touch the stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather! But why don't you come to my room? I've some Scotch&mdash;not
      half bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't want to use up all your hootch. It's darn nice of you, but&mdash;You
      probably want to hit the hay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gerald was transformed. He was beefily yearning. &ldquo;Oh really, now; I
      haven't had a decent evening for so long! Having to go to all these
      dances. No chance to discuss business and that sort of thing. Do be a good
      chap and come along. Won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I? You bet! I just thought maybe&mdash;Say, by golly, it does do a
      fellow good, don't it, to sit and visit about business conditions, after
      he's been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that society
      stuff. I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I'll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's awfully nice of you.&rdquo; They beamed along the street. &ldquo;Look here,
      old chap, can you tell me, do American cities always keep up this dreadful
      social pace? All these magnificent parties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on now, quit your kidding! Gosh, you with court balls and functions
      and everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really, old chap! Mother and I&mdash;Lady Doak, I should say, we
      usually play a hand of bezique and go to bed at ten. Bless my soul, I
      couldn't keep up your beastly pace! And talking! All your American women,
      they know so much&mdash;culture and that sort of thing. This Mrs. McKelvey&mdash;your
      friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, old Lucile. Good kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;she asked me which of the galleries I liked best in Florence. Or
      was it in Firenze? Never been in Italy in my life! And primitives. Did I
      like primitives. Do you know what the deuce a primitive is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I should say not! But I know what a discount for cash is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather! So do I, by George! But primitives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh! Primitives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed with the sound of a Boosters' luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gerald's room was, except for his ponderous and durable English bags,
      very much like the room of George F. Babbitt; and quite in the manner of
      Babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask, looked proud and hospitable, and
      chuckled, &ldquo;Say, when, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was after the third drink that Sir Gerald proclaimed, &ldquo;How do you
      Yankees get the notion that writing chaps like Bertrand Shaw and this
      Wells represent us? The real business England, we think those chaps are
      traitors. Both our countries have their comic Old Aristocracy&mdash;you
      know, old county families, hunting people and all that sort of thing&mdash;and
      we both have our wretched labor leaders, but we both have a backbone of
      sound business men who run the whole show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet. Here's to the real guys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you! Here's to ourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was after the fourth drink that Sir Gerald asked humbly, &ldquo;What do you
      think of North Dakota mortgages?&rdquo; but it was not till after the fifth that
      Babbitt began to call him &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; and Sir Gerald confided, &ldquo;I say, do you
      mind if I pull off my boots?&rdquo; and ecstatically stretched his knightly
      feet, his poor, tired, hot, swollen feet out on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the sixth, Babbitt irregularly arose. &ldquo;Well, I better be hiking
      along. Jerry, you're a regular human being! I wish to thunder we'd been
      better acquainted in Zenith. Lookit. Can't you come back and stay with me
      a while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sorry&mdash;must go to New York to-morrow. Most awfully sorry, old
      boy. I haven't enjoyed an evening so much since I've been in the States.
      Real talk. Not all this social rot. I'd never have let them give me the
      beastly title&mdash;and I didn't get it for nothing, eh?&mdash;if I'd
      thought I'd have to talk to women about primitives and polo! Goodish thing
      to have in Nottingham, though; annoyed the mayor most frightfully when I
      got it; and of course the missus likes it. But nobody calls me 'Jerry' now&mdash;&rdquo;
       He was almost weeping. &ldquo;&mdash;and nobody in the States has treated me
      like a friend till to-night! Good-by, old chap, good-by! Thanks awfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mention it, Jerry. And remember whenever you get to Zenith, the
      latch-string is always out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't forget, old boy, if you ever come to Nottingham, Mother and I
      will be frightfully glad to see you. I shall tell the fellows in
      Nottingham your ideas about Visions and Real Guys&mdash;at our next Rotary
      Club luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt lay abed at his hotel, imagining the Zenith Athletic Club asking
      him, &ldquo;What kind of a time d'you have in Chicago?&rdquo; and his answering, &ldquo;Oh,
      fair; ran around with Sir Gerald Doak a lot;&rdquo; picturing himself meeting
      Lucile McKelvey and admonishing her, &ldquo;You're all right, Mrs. Mac, when you
      aren't trying to pull this highbrow pose. It's just as Gerald Doak says to
      me in Chicago&mdash;oh, yes, Jerry's an old friend of mine&mdash;the wife
      and I are thinking of running over to England to stay with Jerry in his
      castle, next year&mdash;and he said to me, 'Georgie, old bean, I like
      Lucile first-rate, but you and me, George, we got to make her get over
      this highty-tighty hooptediddle way she's got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that evening a thing happened which wrecked his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Regency Hotel cigar-counter he fell to talking with a salesman of
      pianos, and they dined together. Babbitt was filled with friendliness and
      well-being. He enjoyed the gorgeousness of the dining-room: the
      chandeliers, the looped brocade curtains, the portraits of French kings
      against panels of gilded oak. He enjoyed the crowd: pretty women, good
      solid fellows who were &ldquo;liberal spenders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gasped. He stared, and turned away, and stared again. Three tables off,
      with a doubtful sort of woman, a woman at once coy and withered, was Paul
      Riesling, and Paul was supposed to be in Akron, selling tar-roofing. The
      woman was tapping his hand, mooning at him and giggling. Babbitt felt that
      he had encountered something involved and harmful. Paul was talking with
      the rapt eagerness of a man who is telling his troubles. He was
      concentrated on the woman's faded eyes. Once he held her hand and once,
      blind to the other guests, he puckered his lips as though he was
      pretending to kiss her. Babbitt had so strong an impulse to go to Paul
      that he could feel his body uncoiling, his shoulders moving, but he felt,
      desperately, that he must be diplomatic, and not till he saw Paul paying
      the check did he bluster to the piano-salesman, &ldquo;By golly&mdash;friend of mine
      over there&mdash;'scuse me second&mdash;just say hello to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched Paul's shoulder, and cried, &ldquo;Well, when did you hit town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul glared up at him, face hardening. &ldquo;Oh, hello, George. Thought you'd
      gone back to Zenith.&rdquo; He did not introduce his companion. Babbitt peeped
      at her. She was a flabbily pretty, weakly flirtatious woman of forty-two
      or three, in an atrocious flowery hat. Her rouging was thorough but
      unskilful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you staying, Paulibus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman turned, yawned, examined her nails. She seemed accustomed to not
      being introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul grumbled, &ldquo;Campbell Inn, on the South Side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; It sounded insinuating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Unfortunately!&rdquo; Furiously Paul turned toward the woman, smiling with
      a fondness sickening to Babbitt. &ldquo;May! Want to introduce you. Mrs. Arnold,
      this is my old-acquaintance, George Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasmeech,&rdquo; growled Babbitt, while she gurgled, &ldquo;Oh, I'm very pleased to
      meet any friend of Mr. Riesling's, I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt demanded, &ldquo;Be back there later this evening, Paul? I'll drop down
      and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, better&mdash;We better lunch together to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, but I'll see you to-night, too, Paul. I'll go down to your
      hotel, and I'll wait for you!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX

    <p>
      HE sat smoking with the piano-salesman, clinging to the warm refuge of
      gossip, afraid to venture into thoughts of Paul. He was the more affable
      on the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive, felt more hollow.
      He was certain that Paul was in Chicago without Zilla's knowledge, and
      that he was doing things not at all moral and secure. When the salesman
      yawned that he had to write up his orders, Babbitt left him, left the
      hotel, in leisurely calm. But savagely he said &ldquo;Campbell Inn!&rdquo; to the
      taxi-driver. He sat agitated on the slippery leather seat, in that chill
      dimness which smelled of dust and perfume and Turkish cigarettes. He did
      not heed the snowy lake-front, the dark spaces and sudden bright corners
      in the unknown land south of the Loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office of the Campbell Inn was hard, bright, new; the night clerk
      harder and brighter. &ldquo;Yep?&rdquo; he said to Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paul Riesling registered here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you'll give me his key, I'll wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't do that, brother. Wait down here if you wanna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had spoken with the deference which all the Clan of Good Fellows
      give to hotel clerks. Now he said with snarling abruptness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have to wait some time. I'm Riesling's brother-in-law. I'll go up
      to his room. D' I look like a sneak-thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was low and not pleasant. With considerable haste the clerk took
      down the key, protesting, &ldquo;I never said you looked like a sneak-thief.
      Just rules of the hotel. But if you want to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way up in the elevator Babbitt wondered why he was here. Why
      shouldn't Paul be dining with a respectable married woman? Why had he lied
      to the clerk about being Paul's brother-in-law? He had acted like a child.
      He must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to Paul. As he
      settled down he tried to look pompous and placid. Then the thought&mdash;Suicide.
      He'd been dreading that, without knowing it. Paul would be just the person
      to do something like that. He must be out of his head or he wouldn't be
      confiding in that&mdash;that dried-up hag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zilla (oh, damn Zilla! how gladly he'd throttle that nagging fiend of a
      woman!)&mdash;she'd probably succeeded at last, and driven Paul crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suicide. Out there in the lake, way out, beyond the piled ice along the
      shore. It would be ghastly cold to drop into the water to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or&mdash;throat cut&mdash;in the bathroom&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt flung into Paul's bathroom. It was empty. He smiled, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled at his choking collar, looked at his watch, opened the window to
      stare down at the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the evening
      paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. Three
      minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he waited for three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting fixed, chilled, when the doorknob turned. Paul came in
      glowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Paul said. &ldquo;Been waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well what? Just thought I'd drop in to see how you made out in Akron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did all right. What difference does it make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, gosh, Paul, what are you sore about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you butting into my affairs for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Paul, that's no way to talk! I'm not butting into nothing. I was so
      glad to see your ugly old phiz that I just dropped in to say howdy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not going to have anybody following me around and trying to
      boss me. I've had all of that I'm going to stand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gosh, I'm not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't like the way you looked at May Arnold, or the snooty way you
      talked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right then! If you think I'm a buttinsky, then I'll just butt
      in! I don't know who your May Arnold is, but I know doggone good and well
      that you and her weren't talking about tar-roofing, no, nor about playing
      the violin, neither! If you haven't got any moral consideration for
      yourself, you ought to have some for your position in the community. The
      idea of your going around places gawping into a female's eyes like a
      love-sick pup! I can understand a fellow slipping once, but I don't
      propose to see a fellow that's been as chummy with me as you have getting
      started on the downward path and sneaking off from his wife, even as
      cranky a one as Zilla, to go woman-chasing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're a perfectly moral little husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, by God! I've never looked at any woman except Myra since I've been
      married&mdash;practically&mdash;and I never will! I tell you there's
      nothing to immorality. It don't pay. Can't you see, old man, it just makes
      Zilla still crankier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slight of resolution as he was of body, Paul threw his snow-beaded
      overcoat on the floor and crouched on a flimsy cane chair. &ldquo;Oh, you're an
      old blowhard, and you know less about morality than Tinka, but you're all
      right, Georgie. But you can't understand that&mdash;I'm through. I can't
      go Zilla's hammering any longer. She's made up her mind that I'm a devil,
      and&mdash;Reg'lar Inquisition. Torture. She enjoys it. It's a game to see
      how sore she can make me. And me, either it's find a little comfort, any
      comfort, anywhere, or else do something a lot worse. Now this Mrs. Arnold,
      she's not so young, but she's a fine woman and she understands a fellow,
      and she's had her own troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea! I suppose she's one of these hens whose husband 'doesn't understand
      her'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Maybe. He was killed in the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt lumbered up, stood beside Paul patting his shoulder, making soft
      apologetic noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, George, she's a fine woman, and she's had one hell of a time. We
      manage to jolly each other up a lot. We tell each other we're the dandiest
      pair on earth. Maybe we don't believe it, but it helps a lot to have
      somebody with whom you can be perfectly simple, and not all this
      discussing&mdash;explaining&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's as far as you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not! Go on! Say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't&mdash;I can't say I like it, but&mdash;&rdquo; With a burst which
      left him feeling large and shining with generosity, &ldquo;it's none of my darn
      business! I'll do anything I can for you, if there's anything I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be. I judge from Zilla's letters that 've been forwarded from
      Akron that she's getting suspicious about my staying away so long. She'd
      be perfectly capable of having me shadowed, and of coming to Chicago and
      busting into a hotel dining-room and bawling me out before everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take care of Zilla. I'll hand her a good fairy-story when I get back
      to Zenith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I don't think you better try it. You're a good fellow,
      but I don't know that diplomacy is your strong point.&rdquo; Babbitt looked
      hurt, then irritated. &ldquo;I mean with women! With women, I mean. Course they
      got to go some to beat you in business diplomacy, but I just mean with
      women. Zilla may do a lot of rough talking, but she's pretty shrewd. She'd
      have the story out of you in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right, but&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt was still pathetic at not being
      allowed to play Secret Agent. Paul soothed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course maybe you might tell her you'd been in Akron and seen me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure, you bet! Don't I have to go look at that candy-store property
      in Akron? Don't I? Ain't it a shame I have to stop off there when I'm so
      anxious to get home? Ain't it a regular shame? I'll say it is! I'll say
      it's a doggone shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine. But for glory hallelujah's sake don't go putting any fancy fixings
      on the story. When men lie they always try to make it too artistic, and
      that's why women get suspicious. And&mdash;Let's have a drink, Georgie.
      I've got some gin and a little vermouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Paul who normally refused a second cocktail took a second now, and a
      third. He became red-eyed and thick-tongued. He was embarrassingly jocular
      and salacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the taxicab Babbitt incredulously found tears crowding into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not told Paul of his plan but he did stop at Akron, between trains,
      for the one purpose of sending to Zilla a postcard with &ldquo;Had to come here
      for the day, ran into Paul.&rdquo; In Zenith he called on her. If for public
      appearances Zilla was over-coiffed, over-painted, and resolutely corseted,
      for private misery she wore a filthy blue dressing-gown and torn stockings
      thrust into streaky pink satin mules. Her face was sunken. She seemed to
      have but half as much hair as Babbitt remembered, and that half was
      stringy. She sat in a rocker amid a debris of candy-boxes and cheap
      magazines, and she sounded dolorous when she did not sound derisive. But
      Babbitt was exceedingly breezy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Zil, old dear, having a good loaf while hubby's away? That's
      the ideal I'll bet a hat Myra never got up till ten, while I was in
      Chicago. Say, could I borrow your thermos&mdash;just dropped in to see if
      I could borrow your thermos bottle. We're going to have a toboggan party&mdash;want
      to take some coffee mit. Oh, did you get my card from Akron, saying I'd
      run into Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What was he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; He unbuttoned his overcoat, sat tentatively on the arm
      of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how I mean!&rdquo; She slapped the pages of a magazine with an
      irritable clatter. &ldquo;I suppose he was trying to make love to some hotel
      waitress or manicure girl or somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, you're always letting on that Paul goes round chasing skirts. He
      doesn't, in the first place, and if he did, it would prob'ly be because
      you keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much. I hadn't meant to,
      Zilla, but since Paul is away, in Akron&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He really is in Akron? I know he has some horrible woman that he writes
      to in Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I tell you I saw him in Akron? What 're you trying to do? Make me
      out a liar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I just&mdash;I get so worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there you are! That's what gets me! Here you love Paul, and yet you
      plague him and cuss him out as if you hated him. I simply can't understand
      why it is that the more some folks love people, the harder they try to
      make 'em miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love Ted and Rone&mdash;I suppose&mdash;and yet you nag them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Well. That. That's different. Besides, I don't nag 'em. Not what
      you'd call nagging. But zize saying: Now, here's Paul, the nicest, most
      sensitive critter on God's green earth. You ought to be ashamed of
      yourself the way you pan him. Why, you talk to him like a washerwoman. I'm
      surprised you can act so doggone common, Zilla!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brooded over her linked fingers. &ldquo;Oh, I know. I do go and get mean
      sometimes, and I'm sorry afterwards. But, oh, Georgie, Paul is so
      aggravating! Honestly, I've tried awfully hard, these last few years, to
      be nice to him, but just because I used to be spiteful&mdash;or I seemed
      so; I wasn't, really, but I used to speak up and say anything that came
      into my head&mdash;and so he made up his mind that everything was my
      fault. Everything can't always be my fault, can it? And now if I get to
      fussing, he just turns silent, oh, so dreadfully silent, and he won't look
      at me&mdash;he just ignores me. He simply isn't human! And he deliberately
      keeps it up till I bust out and say a lot of things I don't mean. So
      silent&mdash;Oh, you righteous men! How wicked you are! How rotten
      wicked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They thrashed things over and over for half an hour. At the end, weeping
      drably, Zilla promised to restrain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul returned four days later, and the Babbitts and Rieslings went
      festively to the movies and had chop suey at a Chinese restaurant. As they
      walked to the restaurant through a street of tailor shops and barber
      shops, the two wives in front, chattering about cooks, Babbitt murmured to
      Paul, &ldquo;Zil seems a lot nicer now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has been, except once or twice. But it's too late now. I just&mdash;I'm
      not going to discuss it, but I'm afraid of her. There's nothing left. I
      don't ever want to see her. Some day I'm going to break away from her.
      Somehow.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE International Organization of Boosters' Clubs has become a
      world-force for optimism, manly pleasantry, and good business. Chapters
      are to be found now in thirty countries. Nine hundred and twenty of the
      thousand chapters, however, are in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters' Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of
      the year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers.
      There was agitation abroad. The lunch was held in the ballroom of the
      O'Hearn House. As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from a
      wall-board a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nick name, and
      his business. There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster
      by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked
      his hat the air was radiant with shouts of &ldquo;Hello, Chet!&rdquo; and &ldquo;How're you,
      Shorty!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Top o' the mornin', Mac!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot. Babbitt was
      with Albert Boos the merchant tailor, Hector Seybolt of the Little
      Sweetheart Condensed Milk Company, Emil Wengert the jeweler, Professor
      Pumphrey of the Riteway Business College, Dr. Walter Gorbutt, Roy
      Teegarten the photographer, and Ben Berkey the photo-engraver. One of the
      merits of the Boosters' Club was that only two persons from each
      department of business were permitted to join, so that you at once
      encountered the Ideals of other occupations, and realized the metaphysical
      oneness of all occupations&mdash;plumbing and portrait-painting, medicine
      and the manufacture of chewing-gum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's table was particularly happy to-day, because Professor Pumphrey
      had just had a birthday, and was therefore open to teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's pump Pump about how old he is!&rdquo; said Emil Wengert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let's paddle him with a dancing-pump!&rdquo; said Ben Berkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Babbitt who had the applause, with &ldquo;Don't talk about pumps to
      that guy! The only pump he knows is a bottle! Honest, they tell me he's
      starting a class in home-brewing at the ole college!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At each place was the Boosters' Club booklet, listing the members. Though
      the object of the club was good-fellowship, yet they never lost sight of
      the importance of doing a little more business. After each name was the
      member's occupation. There were scores of advertisements in the booklet,
      and on one page the admonition: &ldquo;There's no rule that you have to trade
      with your Fellow Boosters, but get wise, boy&mdash;what's the use of
      letting all this good money get outside of our happy fambly?&rdquo; And at each
      place, to-day, there was a present; a card printed in artistic red and
      black:
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVICE AND BOOSTERISM
    </p>
    <p>
      Service finds its finest opportunity and development only in its broadest
      and deepest application and the consideration of its perpetual action upon
      reaction. I believe the highest type of Service, like the most progressive
      tenets of ethics, senses unceasingly and is motived by active adherence
      and loyalty to that which is the essential principle of Boosterism&mdash;Good
      Citizenship in all its factors and aspects.

      Compliments of Dadbury Petersen Advertising Corp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ads, not Fads, at Dad's&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boosters all read Mr. Peterson's aphorism and said they understood it
      perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting opened with the regular weekly &ldquo;stunts.&rdquo; Retiring President
      Vergil Gunch was in the chair, his stiff hair like a hedge, his voice like
      a brazen gong of festival. Members who had brought guests introduced them
      publicly. &ldquo;This tall red-headed piece of misinformation is the sporting
      editor of the Press,&rdquo; said Willis Ijams; and H. H. Hazen, the druggist,
      chanted, &ldquo;Boys, when you're on a long motor tour and finally get to a
      romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife, 'This is
      certainly a romantic place,' it sends a glow right up and down your
      vertebrae. Well, my guest to-day is from such a place, Harper's Ferry,
      Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of good old General
      Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who, like every good
      Booster, goes marching on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the
      &ldquo;Bird of Paradise&rdquo; company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater,
      and the mayor of Zenith, the Hon. Lucas Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vergil Gunch thundered, &ldquo;When we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian
      off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses&mdash;and I got to admit
      I butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters
      appreciated the high-class artistic performance he's giving us&mdash;and
      don't forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will
      appreciate our patronage&mdash;and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor
      out of his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we've done
      ourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the problems
      and duties&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which the
      ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations,
      donated, President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the
      Jennifer Avenue florist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the
      pleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services to
      four fellow-members, chosen by lot. There was laughter, this week, when it
      was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the
      undertaker. Everybody whispered, &ldquo;I can think of a coupla good guys to be
      buried if his donation is a free funeral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all these diversions the Boosters were lunching on chicken
      croquettes, peas, fried potatoes, coffee, apple pie, and American cheese.
      Gunch did not lump the speeches. Presently he called on the visiting
      secretary of the Zenith Rotary Club, a rival organization. The secretary
      had the distinction of possessing State Motor Car License Number 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the
      state so low a number created a sensation, and &ldquo;though it was pretty nice
      to have the honor, yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn well, and
      sometimes he didn't know but what he'd almost as soon have just plain
      B56,876 or something like that. Only let any doggone Booster try to get
      Number 5 away from a live Rotarian next year, and watch the fur fly! And
      if they'd permit him, he'd wind up by calling for a cheer for the Boosters
      and Rotarians and the Kiwanis all together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt sighed to Professor Pumphrey, &ldquo;Be pretty nice to have as low a
      number as that! Everybody 'd say, 'He must be an important guy!' Wonder
      how he got it? I'll bet he wined and dined the superintendent of the Motor
      License Bureau to a fare-you-well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Chum Frink addressed them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of you may feel that it's out of place here to talk on a strictly
      highbrow and artistic subject, but I want to come out flatfooted and ask
      you boys to O.K. the proposition of a Symphony Orchestra for Zenith. Now,
      where a lot of you make your mistake is in assuming that if you don't like
      classical music and all that junk, you ought to oppose it. Now, I want to
      confess that, though I'm a literary guy by profession, I don't care a rap
      for all this long-haired music. I'd rather listen to a good jazz band any
      time than to some piece by Beethoven that hasn't any more tune to it than
      a bunch of fighting cats, and you couldn't whistle it to save your life!
      But that isn't the point. Culture has become as necessary an adornment and
      advertisement for a city to-day as pavements or bank-clearances. It's
      Culture, in theaters and art-galleries and so on, that brings thousands of
      visitors to New York every year and, to be frank, for all our splendid
      attainments we haven't yet got the Culture of a New York or Chicago or
      Boston&mdash;or at least we don't get the credit for it. The thing to do
      then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is to CAPITALIZE CULTURE; to go right
      out and grab it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study 'em,
      but they don't shoot out on the road and holler 'This is what little old
      Zenith can put up in the way of Culture.' That's precisely what a Symphony
      Orchestra does do. Look at the credit Minneapolis and Cincinnati get. An
      orchestra with first-class musickers and a swell conductor&mdash;and I
      believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get one of the highest-paid
      conductors on the market, providing he ain't a Hun&mdash;it goes right
      into Beantown and New York and Washington; it plays at the best theaters
      to the most cultured and moneyed people; it gives such class-advertising
      as a town can get in no other way; and the guy who is so short-sighted as
      to crab this orchestra proposition is passing up the chance to impress the
      glorious name of Zenith on some big New York millionaire that might-that
      might establish a branch factory here!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could also go into the fact that for our daughters who show an interest
      in highbrow music and may want to teach it, having an A1 local
      organization is of great benefit, but let's keep this on a practical
      basis, and I call on you good brothers to whoop it up for Culture and a
      World-beating Symphony Orchestra!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They applauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a rustle of excitement President Gunch proclaimed, &ldquo;Gentlemen, we will
      now proceed to the annual election of officers.&rdquo; For each of the six
      offices, three candidates had been chosen by a committee. The second name
      among the candidates for vice-president was Babbitt's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised. He looked self-conscious. His heart pounded. He was
      still more agitated when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, &ldquo;It's a
      pleasure to announce that Georgie Babbitt will be the next assistant
      gavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common sense
      and enterprise than good old George. Come on, let's give him our best long
      yell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. He had never
      known a higher moment. He drove away in a blur of wonder. He lunged into
      his office, chuckling to Miss McGoun, &ldquo;Well, I guess you better
      congratulate your boss! Been elected vice-president of the Boosters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was disappointed. She answered only, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Oh, Mrs. Babbitt's been
      trying to get you on the 'phone.&rdquo; But the new salesman, Fritz Weilinger,
      said, &ldquo;By golly, chief, say, that's great, that's perfectly great! I'm
      tickled to death! Congratulations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, &ldquo;Heard you were trying
      to get me, Myra. Say, you got to hand it to little Georgie, this time!
      Better talk careful! You are now addressing the vice-president of the
      Boosters' Club!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Georgie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nice, huh? Willis Ijams is the new president, but when he's away,
      little ole Georgie takes the gavel and whoops 'em up and introduces the
      speakers&mdash;no matter if they're the governor himself&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;It puts him in solid with big men like Doc Dilling and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! Paul Riesling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sure, I'll 'phone Paul and let him know about it right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie! LISTEN! Paul's in jail. He shot his wife, he shot Zilla, this
      noon. She may not live.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HE drove to the City Prison, not blindly, but with unusual fussy care at
      corners, the fussiness of an old woman potting plants. It kept him from
      facing the obscenity of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant said, &ldquo;Naw, you can't see any of the prisoners till
      three-thirty&mdash;visiting-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was three. For half an hour Babbitt sat looking at a calendar and a
      clock on a whitewashed wall. The chair was hard and mean and creaky.
      People went through the office and, he thought, stared at him. He felt a
      belligerent defiance which broke into a wincing fear of this machine which
      was grinding Paul&mdash;Paul&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly at half-past three he sent in his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant returned with &ldquo;Riesling says he don't want to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're crazy! You didn't give him my name! Tell him it's George wants to
      see him, George Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, I told him, all right, all right! He said he didn't want to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take me in anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing. If you ain't his lawyer, if he don't want to see you,
      that's all there is to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my GOD&mdash;Say, let me see the warden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's busy. Come on, now, you&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt reared over him. The
      attendant hastily changed to a coaxing &ldquo;You can come back and try
      to-morrow. Probably the poor guy is off his nut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt drove, not at all carefully or fussily, sliding viciously past
      trucks, ignoring the truckmen's curses, to the City Hall; he stopped with
      a grind of wheels against the curb, and ran up the marble steps to the
      office of the Hon. Mr. Lucas Prout, the mayor. He bribed the mayor's
      doorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, &ldquo;You remember
      me, Mr. Prout? Babbitt&mdash;vice-president of the Boosters&mdash;campaigned
      for you? Say, have you heard about poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on
      the warden or whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back and
      see him. Good. Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage
      where Paul Riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs
      crossed, arms in a knot, biting at his clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted Babbitt,
      and left them together. He spoke slowly: &ldquo;Go on! Be moral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt plumped on the couch beside him. &ldquo;I'm not going to be moral! I
      don't care what happened! I just want to do anything I can. I'm glad Zilla
      got what was coming to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul said argumentatively, &ldquo;Now, don't go jumping on Zilla. I've been
      thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot her&mdash;I
      didn't hardly mean to, but she got to deviling me so I went crazy, just
      for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to shoot
      rabbits with, and took a crack at her. Didn't hardly mean to&mdash;After
      that, when I was trying to stop the blood&mdash;It was terrible what it
      did to her shoulder, and she had beautiful skin&mdash;Maybe she won't die.
      I hope it won't leave her skin all scarred. But just afterward, when I was
      hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood, I ran onto
      a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one Christmas, and I
      remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then&mdash;Hell. I can't hardly
      believe it's me here.&rdquo; As Babbitt's arm tightened about his shoulder, Paul
      sighed, &ldquo;I'm glad you came. But I thought maybe you'd lecture me, and when
      you've committed a murder, and been brought here and everything&mdash;there
      was a big crowd outside the apartment house, all staring, and the cops
      took me through it&mdash;Oh, I'm not going to talk about it any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he went on, in a monotonous, terrified insane mumble. To divert him
      Babbitt said, &ldquo;Why, you got a scar on your cheek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That's where the cop hit me. I suppose cops get a lot of fun out of
      lecturing murderers, too. He was a big fellow. And they wouldn't let me
      help carry Zilla down to the ambulance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul! Quit it! Listen: she won't die, and when it's all over you and I'll
      go off to Maine again. And maybe we can get that May Arnold to go along.
      I'll go up to Chicago and ask her. Good woman, by golly. And afterwards
      I'll see that you get started in business out West somewhere, maybe
      Seattle&mdash;they say that's a lovely city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul was half smiling. It was Babbitt who rambled now. He could not tell
      whether Paul was heeding, but he droned on till the coming of Paul's
      lawyer, P. J. Maxwell, a thin, busy, unfriendly man who nodded at Babbitt
      and hinted, &ldquo;If Riesling and I could be alone for a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt wrung Paul's hands, and waited in the office till Maxwell came
      pattering out. &ldquo;Look, old man, what can I do?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Not a thing. Not just now,&rdquo; said Maxwell. &ldquo;Sorry. Got to hurry.
      And don't try to see him. I've had the doctor give him a shot of morphine,
      so he'll sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed somehow wicked to return to the office. Babbitt felt as though
      he had just come from a funeral. He drifted out to the City Hospital to
      inquire about Zilla. She was not likely to die, he learned. The bullet
      from Paul's huge old .44 army revolver had smashed her shoulder and torn
      upward and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered home and found his wife radiant with the horified interest we
      have in the tragedies of our friends. &ldquo;Of course Paul isn't altogether to
      blame, but this is what comes of his chasing after other women instead of
      bearing his cross in a Christian way,&rdquo; she exulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too languid to respond as he desired. He said what was to be said
      about the Christian bearing of crosses, and went out to clean the car.
      Dully, patiently, he scraped linty grease from the drip-pan, gouged at the
      mud caked on the wheels. He used up many minutes in washing his hands;
      scoured them with gritty kitchen soap; rejoiced in hurting his plump
      knuckles. &ldquo;Damn soft hands&mdash;like a woman's. Aah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, when his wife began the inevitable, he bellowed, &ldquo;I forbid any
      of you to say a word about Paul! I'll 'tend to all the talking about this
      that's necessary, hear me? There's going to be one house in this
      scandal-mongering town to-night that isn't going to spring the
      holier-than-thou. And throw those filthy evening papers out of the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he himself read the papers, after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before nine he set out for the house of Lawyer Maxwell. He was received
      without cordiality. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Maxwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to offer my services in the trial. I've got an idea. Why couldn't
      I go on the stand and swear I was there, and she pulled the gun first and
      he wrestled with her and the gun went off accidentally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perjure yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh? Yes, I suppose it would be perjury. Oh&mdash;Would it help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow! Perjury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't be a fool! Excuse me, Maxwell; I didn't mean to get your goat.
      I just mean: I've known and you've known many and many a case of perjury,
      just to annex some rotten little piece of real estate, and here where it's
      a case of saving Paul from going to prison, I'd perjure myself black in
      the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Aside from the ethics of the matter, I'm afraid it isn't practicable.
      The prosecutor would tear your testimony to pieces. It's known that only
      Riesling and his wife were there at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, look here! Let me go on the stand and swear&mdash;and this would be
      the God's truth&mdash;that she pestered him till he kind of went crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Sorry. Riesling absolutely refuses to have any testimony reflecting
      on his wife. He insists on pleading guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me get up and testify something&mdash;whatever you say. Let me
      do SOMETHING!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do&mdash;I hate to say it,
      but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so
      visibly that Maxwell condescended:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our
      best for Riesling, and we mustn't consider any other factor. The trouble
      with you, Babbitt, is that you're one of these fellows who talk too
      readily. You like to hear your own voice. If there were anything for which
      I could put you in the witness-box, you'd get going and give the whole
      show away. Sorry. Now I must look over some papers&mdash;So sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent most of the next morning nerving himself to face the garrulous
      world of the Athletic Club. They would talk about Paul; they would be
      lip-licking and rotten. But at the Roughnecks' Table they did not mention
      Paul. They spoke with zeal of the coming baseball season. He loved them as
      he never had before.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, doubtless from some story-book, pictured Paul's trial as a long
      struggle, with bitter arguments, a taut crowd, and sudden and overwhelming
      new testimony. Actually, the trial occupied less than fifteen minutes,
      largely filled with the evidence of doctors that Zilla would recover and
      that Paul must have been temporarily insane. Next day Paul was sentenced
      to three years in the State Penitentiary and taken off&mdash;quite
      undramatically, not handcuffed, merely plodding in a tired way beside a
      cheerful deputy sheriff&mdash;and after saying good-by to him at the
      station Babbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a world
      which, without Paul, was meaningless.

      CHAPTER XXIII

    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HE was busy, from March to June. He kept himself from the bewilderment of
      thinking. His wife and the neighbors were generous. Every evening he
      played bridge or attended the movies, and the days were blank of face and
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went East, to stay with relatives, and
      Babbitt was free to do&mdash;he was not quite sure what.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long after their departure he thought of the emancipated house in
      which he could, if he desired, go mad and curse the gods without having to
      keep up a husbandly front. He considered, &ldquo;I could have a reg'lar party
      to-night; stay out till two and not do any explaining afterwards. Cheers!&rdquo;
       He telephoned to Vergil Gunch, to Eddie Swanson. Both of them were engaged
      for the evening, and suddenly he was bored by having to take so much
      trouble to be riotous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent at dinner, unusually kindly to Ted and Verona, hesitating
      but not disapproving when Verona stated her opinion of Kenneth Escott's
      opinion of Dr. John Jennison Drew's opinion of the opinions of the
      evolutionists. Ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation,
      and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race,
      what he had said to the Old Grouch, what he had said to the foreman about
      the future of wireless telephony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted and Verona went to a dance after dinner. Even the maid was out. Rarely
      had Babbitt been alone in the house for an entire evening. He was
      restless. He vaguely wanted something more diverting than the newspaper
      comic strips to read. He ambled up to Verona's room, sat on her maidenly
      blue and white bed, humming and grunting in a solid-citizen manner as he
      examined her books: Conrad's &ldquo;Rescue,&rdquo; a volume strangely named &ldquo;Figures
      of Earth,&rdquo; poetry (quite irregular poetry, Babbitt thought) by Vachel
      Lindsay, and essays by H. L. Mencken&mdash;highly improper essays, making
      fun of the church and all the decencies. He liked none of the books. In
      them he felt a spirit of rebellion against niceness and solid-citizenship.
      These authors&mdash;and he supposed they were famous ones, too&mdash;did
      not seem to care about telling a good story which would enable a fellow to
      forget his troubles. He sighed. He noted a book, &ldquo;The Three Black
      Pennies,&rdquo; by Joseph Hergesheimer. Ah, that was something like it! It would
      be an adventure story, maybe about counterfeiting&mdash;detectives
      sneaking up on the old house at night. He tucked the book under his arm,
      he clumped down-stairs and solemnly began to read, under the piano-lamp:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A twilight like blue dust sifted into the shallow fold of the thickly
      wooded hills. It was early October, but a crisping frost had already
      stamped the maple trees with gold, the Spanish oaks were hung with patches
      of wine red, the sumach was brilliant in the darkening underbrush. A
      pattern of wild geese, flying low and unconcerned above the hills, wavered
      against the serene ashen evening. Howat Penny, standing in the comparative
      clearing of a road, decided that the shifting regular flight would not
      come close enough for a shot.... He had no intention of hunting the geese.
      With the drooping of day his keenness had evaporated; an habitual
      indifference strengthened, permeating him....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There it was again: discontent with the good common ways. Babbitt laid
      down the book and listened to the stillness. The inner doors of the house
      were open. He heard from the kitchen the steady drip of the refrigerator,
      a rhythm demanding and disquieting. He roamed to the window. The summer
      evening was foggy and, seen through the wire screen, the street lamps were
      crosses of pale fire. The whole world was abnormal. While he brooded,
      Verona and Ted came in and went up to bed. Silence thickened in the
      sleeping house. He put on his hat, his respectable derby, lighted a cigar,
      and walked up and down before the house, a portly, worthy, unimaginative
      figure, humming &ldquo;Silver Threads among the Gold.&rdquo; He casually considered,
      &ldquo;Might call up Paul.&rdquo; Then he remembered. He saw Paul in a jailbird's
      uniform, but while he agonized he didn't believe the tale. It was part of
      the unreality of this fog-enchanted evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she were here Myra would be hinting, &ldquo;Isn't it late, Georgie?&rdquo; He
      tramped in forlorn and unwanted freedom. Fog hid the house now. The world
      was uncreated, a chaos without turmoil or desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the mist came a man at so feverish a pace that he seemed to dance
      with fury as he entered the orb of glow from a street-lamp. At each step
      he brandished his stick and brought it down with a crash. His glasses on
      their broad pretentious ribbon banged against his stomach. Babbitt
      incredulously saw that it was Chum Frink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frink stopped, focused his vision, and spoke with gravity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another fool. George Babbitt. Lives for renting howshes&mdash;houses.
      Know who I am? I'm traitor to poetry. I'm drunk. I'm talking too much. I
      don't care. Know what I could 've been? I could 've been a Gene Field or a
      James Whitcomb Riley. Maybe a Stevenson. I could 've. Whimsies.
      'Magination. Lissen. Lissen to this. Just made it up:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Glittering summery meadowy noise
     Of beetles and bums and respectable boys.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hear that? Whimzh&mdash;whimsy. I made that up. I don't know what it
      means! Beginning good verse. Chile's Garden Verses. And whadi write?
      Tripe! Cheer-up poems. All tripe! Could have written&mdash;Too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted on with an alarming plunge, seeming always to pitch forward yet
      never quite falling. Babbitt would have been no more astonished and no
      less had a ghost skipped out of the fog carrying his head. He accepted
      Frink with vast apathy; he grunted, &ldquo;Poor boob!&rdquo; and straightway forgot
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He plodded into the house, deliberately went to the refrigerator and
      rifled it. When Mrs. Babbitt was at home, this was one of the major
      household crimes. He stood before the covered laundry tubs, eating a
      chicken leg and half a saucer of raspberry jelly, and grumbling over a
      clammy cold boiled potato. He was thinking. It was coming to him that
      perhaps all life as he knew it and vigorously practised it was futile;
      that heaven as portrayed by the Reverend Dr. John Jennison Drew was
      neither probable nor very interesting; that he hadn't much pleasure out of
      making money; that it was of doubtful worth to rear children merely that
      they might rear children who would rear children. What was it all about?
      What did he want?
    </p>
    <p>
      He blundered into the living-room, lay on the davenport, hands behind his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he want? Wealth? Social position? Travel? Servants? Yes, but only
      incidentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did know that he wanted the presence of Paul Riesling; and from
      that he stumbled into the admission that he wanted the fairy girl&mdash;in
      the flesh. If there had been a woman whom he loved, he would have fled to
      her, humbled his forehead on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of his stenographer, Miss McGoun. He thought of the prettiest
      of the manicure girls at the Hotel Thornleigh barber shop. As he fell
      asleep on the davenport he felt that he had found something in life, and
      that he had made a terrifying, thrilling break with everything that was
      decent and normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten, next morning, that he was a conscious rebel, but he was
      irritable in the office and at the eleven o'clock drive of telephone calls
      and visitors he did something he had often desired and never dared: he
      left the office without excuses to those slave-drivers his employees, and
      went to the movies. He enjoyed the right to be alone. He came out with a
      vicious determination to do what he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the Roughnecks' Table at the club, everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's the millionaire!&rdquo; said Sidney Finkelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw him in his Locomobile!&rdquo; said Professor Pumphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, it must be great to be a smart guy like Georgie!&rdquo; moaned Vergil
      Gunch. &ldquo;He's probably stolen all of Dorchester. I'd hate to leave a poor
      little defenseless piece of property lying around where he could get his
      hooks on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had, Babbitt perceived, &ldquo;something on him.&rdquo; Also, they &ldquo;had their
      kidding clothes on.&rdquo; Ordinarily he would have been delighted at the honor
      implied in being chaffed, but he was suddenly touchy. He grunted, &ldquo;Yuh,
      sure; maybe I'll take you guys on as office boys!&rdquo; He was impatient as the
      jest elaborately rolled on to its denouement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he may have been meeting a girl,&rdquo; they said, and &ldquo;No, I think
      he was waiting for his old roommate, Sir Jerusalem Doak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He exploded, &ldquo;Oh, spring it, spring it, you boneheads! What's the great
      joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurray! George is peeved!&rdquo; snickered Sidney Finkelstein, while a grin
      went round the table. Gunch revealed the shocking truth: He had seen
      Babbitt coming out of a motion-picture theater&mdash;at noon!
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept it up. With a hundred variations, a hundred guffaws, they said
      that he had gone to the movies during business-hours. He didn't so much
      mind Gunch, but he was annoyed by Sidney Finkelstein, that brisk, lean,
      red-headed explainer of jokes. He was bothered, too, by the lump of ice in
      his glass of water. It was too large; it spun round and burned his nose
      when he tried to drink. He raged that Finkelstein was like that lump of
      ice. But he won through; he kept up his banter till they grew tired of the
      superlative jest and turned to the great problems of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected, &ldquo;What's the matter with me to-day? Seems like I've got an
      awful grouch. Only they talk so darn much. But I better steer careful and
      keep my mouth shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they lighted their cigars he mumbled, &ldquo;Got to get back,&rdquo; and on a
      chorus of &ldquo;If you WILL go spending your mornings with lady ushers at the
      movies!&rdquo; he escaped. He heard them giggling. He was embarrassed. While he
      was most bombastically agreeing with the coat-man that the weather was
      warm, he was conscious that he was longing to run childishly with his
      troubles to the comfort of the fairy child.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept Miss McGoun after he had finished dictating. He searched for a
      topic which would warm her office impersonality into friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you going on your vacation?&rdquo; he purred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll go up-state to a farm do you want me to have the Siddons
      lease copied this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no hurry about it.... I suppose you have a great time when you get
      away from us cranks in the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and gathered her pencils. &ldquo;Oh, nobody's cranky here I think I can
      get it copied after I do the letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone. Babbitt utterly repudiated the view that he had been trying
      to discover how approachable was Miss McGoun. &ldquo;Course! knew there was
      nothing doing!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Eddie Swanson, the motor-car agent who lived across the street from
      Babbitt, was giving a Sunday supper. His wife Louetta, young Louetta who
      loved jazz in music and in clothes and laughter, was at her wildest. She
      cried, &ldquo;We'll have a real party!&rdquo; as she received the guests. Babbitt had
      uneasily felt that to many men she might be alluring; now he admitted that
      to himself she was overwhelmingly alluring. Mrs. Babbitt had never quite
      approved of Louetta; Babbitt was glad that she was not here this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He insisted on helping Louetta in the kitchen: taking the chicken
      croquettes from the warming-oven, the lettuce sandwiches from the ice-box.
      He held her hand, once, and she depressingly didn't notice it. She
      caroled, &ldquo;You're a good little mother's-helper, Georgie. Now trot in with
      the tray and leave it on the side-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wished that Eddie Swanson would give them cocktails; that Louetta would
      have one. He wanted&mdash;Oh, he wanted to be one of these Bohemians you
      read about. Studio parties. Wild lovely girls who were independent. Not
      necessarily bad. Certainly not! But not tame, like Floral Heights. How
      he'd ever stood it all these years&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eddie did not give them cocktails. True, they supped with mirth, and with
      several repetitions by Orville Jones of &ldquo;Any time Louetta wants to come
      sit on my lap I'll tell this sandwich to beat it!&rdquo; but they were
      respectable, as befitted Sunday evening. Babbitt had discreetly preempted
      a place beside Louetta on the piano bench. While he talked about motors,
      while he listened with a fixed smile to her account of the film she had
      seen last Wednesday, while he hoped that she would hurry up and finish her
      description of the plot, the beauty of the leading man, and the luxury of
      the setting, he studied her. Slim waist girdled with raw silk, strong
      brows, ardent eyes, hair parted above a broad forehead&mdash;she meant
      youth to him and a charm which saddened. He thought of how valiant a
      companion she would be on a long motor tour, exploring mountains,
      picnicking in a pine grove high above a valley. Her frailness touched him;
      he was angry at Eddie Swanson for the incessant family bickering. All at
      once he identified Louetta with the fairy girl. He was startled by the
      conviction that they had always had a romantic attraction for each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you're leading a simply terrible life, now you're a widower,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! I'm a bad little fellow and proud of it. Some evening you slip
      Eddie some dope in his coffee and sneak across the road and I'll show you
      how to mix a cocktail,&rdquo; he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I might do it! You never can tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whenever you're ready, you just hang a towel out of the attic
      window and I'll jump for the gin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one giggled at this naughtiness. In a pleased way Eddie Swanson
      stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. The others
      were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent murders, but
      Babbitt drew Louetta back to personal things:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the prettiest dress I ever saw in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you honestly like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it? Why, say, I'm going to have Kenneth Escott put a piece in the
      paper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the U. S. is Mrs. E.
      Louetta Swanson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you stop teasing me!&rdquo; But she beamed. &ldquo;Let's dance a little. George,
      you've got to dance with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he protested, &ldquo;Oh, you know what a rotten dancer I am!&rdquo; he was
      lumbering to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll teach you. I can teach anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were moist, her voice was jagged with excitement. He was
      convinced that he had won her. He clasped her, conscious of her smooth
      warmth, and solemnly he circled in a heavy version of the one-step. He
      bumped into only one or two people. &ldquo;Gosh, I'm not doing so bad; hittin'
      'em up like a regular stage dancer!&rdquo; he gloated; and she answered busily,
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I told you I could teach anybody&mdash;DON'T TAKE
      SUCH LONG STEPS!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he was robbed of confidence; with fearful concentration he
      sought to keep time to the music. But he was enveloped again by her
      enchantment. &ldquo;She's got to like me; I'll make her!&rdquo; he vowed. He tried to
      kiss the lock beside her ear. She mechanically moved her head to avoid it,
      and mechanically she murmured, &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he hated her, but after the moment he was as urgent as ever.
      He danced with Mrs. Orville Jones, but he watched Louetta swooping down
      the length of the room with her husband. &ldquo;Careful! You're getting
      foolish!&rdquo; he cautioned himself, the while he hopped and bent his solid
      knees in dalliance with Mrs. Jones, and to that worthy lady rumbled, &ldquo;Gee,
      it's hot!&rdquo; Without reason, he thought of Paul in that shadowy place where
      men never dance. &ldquo;I'm crazy to-night; better go home,&rdquo; he worried, but he
      left Mrs. Jones and dashed to Louetta's lovely side, demanding, &ldquo;The next
      is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so hot; I'm not going to dance this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; boldly, &ldquo;come out and sit on the porch and get all nice and cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the tender darkness, with the clamor in the house behind them, he
      resolutely took her hand. She squeezed his once, then relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louetta! I think you're the nicest thing I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you're very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? You got to like me! I'm so lonely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll be all right when your wife comes home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm always lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands under her chin, so that he dared not touch her. He
      sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I feel punk and&mdash;&rdquo; He was about to bring in the tragedy of
      Paul, but that was too sacred even for the diplomacy of love. &ldquo;&mdash;when
      I get tired out at the office and everything, I like to look across the
      street and think of you. Do you know I dreamed of you, one time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it a nice dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, they say dreams go by opposites! Now I must run in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't go in yet! Please, Louetta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must. Have to look out for my guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em look out for 'emselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't do that.&rdquo; She carelessly tapped his shoulder and slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after two minutes of shamed and childish longing to sneak home he was
      snorting, &ldquo;Certainly I wasn't trying to get chummy with her! Knew there
      was nothing doing, all the time!&rdquo; and he ambled in to dance with Mrs.
      Orville Jones, and to avoid Louetta, virtuously and conspicuously.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HIS visit to Paul was as unreal as his night of fog and questioning.
      Unseeing he went through prison corridors stinking of carbolic acid to a
      room lined with pale yellow settees pierced in rosettes, like the
      shoe-store benches he had known as a boy. The guard led in Paul. Above his
      uniform of linty gray, Paul's face was pale and without expression. He
      moved timorously in response to the guard's commands; he meekly pushed
      Babbitt's gifts of tobacco and magazines across the table to the guard for
      examination. He had nothing to say but &ldquo;Oh, I'm getting used to it&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;I'm working in the tailor shop; the stuff hurts my fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt knew that in this place of death Paul was already dead. And as he
      pondered on the train home something in his own self seemed to have died:
      a loyal and vigorous faith in the goodness of the world, a fear of public
      disfavor, a pride in success. He was glad that his wife was away. He
      admitted it without justifying it. He did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Her card read &ldquo;Mrs. Daniel Judique.&rdquo; Babbitt knew of her as the widow of a
      wholesale paper-dealer. She must have been forty or forty-two but he
      thought her younger when he saw her in the office, that afternoon. She had
      come to inquire about renting an apartment, and he took her away from the
      unskilled girl accountant. He was nervously attracted by her smartness.
      She was a slender woman, in a black Swiss frock dotted with white, a
      cool-looking graceful frock. A broad black hat shaded her face. Her eyes
      were lustrous, her soft chin of an agreeable plumpness, and her cheeks an
      even rose. Babbitt wondered afterward if she was made up, but no man
      living knew less of such arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat revolving her violet parasol. Her voice was appealing without
      being coy. &ldquo;I wonder if you can help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've looked everywhere and&mdash;I want a little flat, just a bedroom, or
      perhaps two, and sitting-room and kitchenette and bath, but I want one
      that really has some charm to it, not these dingy places or these new ones
      with terrible gaudy chandeliers. And I can't pay so dreadfully much. My
      name's Tanis Judique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think maybe I've got just the thing for you. Would you like to chase
      around and look at it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have a couple of hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the new Cavendish Apartments, Babbitt had a flat which he had been
      holding for Sidney Finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside this
      agreeable woman he threw over his friend Finkelstein, and with a note of
      gallantry he proclaimed, &ldquo;I'll let you see what I can do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in
      showing off his driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do know how to handle a car!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked her voice. There was, he thought, music in it and a hint of
      culture, not a bouncing giggle like Louetta Swanson's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He boasted, &ldquo;You know, there's a lot of these fellows that are so scared
      and drive so slow that they get in everybody's way. The safest driver is a
      fellow that knows how to handle his machine and yet isn't scared to speed
      up when it's necessary, don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you drive like a wiz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I mean&mdash;not really. Of course, we had a car&mdash;I
      mean, before my husband passed on&mdash;and I used to make believe drive
      it, but I don't think any woman ever learns to drive like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, there's some mighty good woman drivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, these women that try to imitate men, and play golf and
      everything, and ruin their complexions and spoil their hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. I never did like these mannish females.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;of course, I admire them, dreadfully, and I feel so weak and
      useless beside them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats now! I bet you play the piano like a wiz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I mean&mdash;not really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll bet you do!&rdquo; He glanced at her smooth hands, her diamond and
      ruby rings. She caught the glance, snuggled her hands together with a
      kittenish curving of slim white fingers which delighted him, and yearned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love to play&mdash;I mean&mdash;I like to drum on the piano, but I
      haven't had any real training. Mr. Judique used to say I would 've been a
      good pianist if I'd had any training, but then, I guess he was just
      flattering me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet he wasn't! I'll bet you've got temperament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Do you like music, Mr Babbitt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I do! Only I don't know 's I care so much for all this classical
      stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do! I just love Chopin and all those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, honest? Well, of course, I go to lots of these highbrow concerts,
      but I do like a good jazz orchestra, right up on its toes, with the fellow
      that plays the bass fiddle spinning it around and beating it up with the
      bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. I do love good dance music. I love to dance, don't you, Mr.
      Babbitt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, you bet. Not that I'm very darn good at it, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sure you are. You ought to let me teach you. I can teach anybody
      to dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you give me a lesson some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better be careful, or I'll be taking you up on that proposition. I'll be
      coming up to your flat and making you give me that lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo; She was not offended, but she was non-committal. He warned
      himself, &ldquo;Have some sense now, you chump! Don't go making a fool of
      yourself again!&rdquo; and with loftiness he discoursed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could dance like some of these young fellows, but I'll tell you:
      I feel it's a man's place to take a full, you might say, a creative share
      in the world's work and mold conditions and have something to show for his
      life, don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I have to sacrifice some of the things I might like to tackle,
      though I do, by golly, play about as good a game of golf as the next
      fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sure you do.... Are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh&mdash;yes.... And, uh, of course official duties I'm the
      vice-president of the Boosters' Club, and I'm running one of the
      committees of the State Association of Real Estate Boards, and that means
      a lot of work and responsibility&mdash;and practically no gratitude for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know! Public men never do get proper credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other with a high degree of mutual respect, and at the
      Cavendish Apartments he helped her out in a courtly manner, waved his hand
      at the house as though he were presenting it to her, and ponderously
      ordered the elevator boy to &ldquo;hustle and get the keys.&rdquo; She stood close to
      him in the elevator, and he was stirred but cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty flat, of white woodwork and soft blue walls. Mrs. Judique
      gushed with pleasure as she agreed to take it, and as they walked down the
      hall to the elevator she touched his sleeve, caroling, &ldquo;Oh, I'm so glad I
      went to you! It's such a privilege to meet a man who really Understands.
      Oh! The flats SOME people have showed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a sharp instinctive belief that he could put his arm around her,
      but he rebuked himself and with excessive politeness he saw her to the
      car, drove her home. All the way back to his office he raged:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad I had some sense for once.... Curse it, I wish I'd tried. She's a
      darling! A corker! A reg'lar charmer! Lovely eyes and darling lips and
      that trim waist&mdash;never get sloppy, like some women.... No, no, no!
      She's a real cultured lady. One of the brightest little women I've met
      these many moons. Understands about Public Topics and&mdash;But, darn it,
      why didn't I try? . . . Tanis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      He was harassed and puzzled by it, but he found that he was turning toward
      youth, as youth. The girl who especially disturbed him&mdash;though he had
      never spoken to her&mdash;was the last manicure girl on the right in the
      Pompeian Barber Shop. She was small, swift, black-haired, smiling. She was
      nineteen, perhaps, or twenty. She wore thin salmon-colored blouses which
      exhibited her shoulders and her black-ribboned camisoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the Pompeian for his fortnightly hair-trim. As always, he felt
      disloyal at deserting his neighbor, the Reeves Building Barber Shop. Then,
      for the first time, he overthrew his sense of guilt. &ldquo;Doggone it, I don't
      have to go here if I don't want to! I don't own the Reeves Building! These
      barbers got nothing on me! I'll doggone well get my hair cut where I
      doggone well want to! Don't want to hear anything more about it! I'm
      through standing by people&mdash;unless I want to. It doesn't get you
      anywhere. I'm through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pompeian Barber Shop was in the basement of the Hotel Thornleigh,
      largest and most dynamically modern hotel in Zenith. Curving marble steps
      with a rail of polished brass led from the hotel-lobby down to the barber
      shop. The interior was of black and white and crimson tiles, with a
      sensational ceiling of burnished gold, and a fountain in which a massive
      nymph forever emptied a scarlet cornucopia. Forty barbers and nine
      manicure girls worked desperately, and at the door six colored porters
      lurked to greet the customers, to care reverently for their hats and
      collars, to lead them to a place of waiting where, on a carpet like a
      tropic isle in the stretch of white stone floor, were a dozen leather
      chairs and a table heaped with magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's porter was an obsequious gray-haired negro who did him an honor
      highly esteemed in the land of Zenith&mdash;greeted him by name. Yet
      Babbitt was unhappy. His bright particular manicure girl was engaged. She
      was doing the nails of an overdressed man and giggling with him. Babbitt
      hated him. He thought of waiting, but to stop the powerful system of the
      Pompeian was inconceivable, and he was instantly wafted into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      About him was luxury, rich and delicate. One votary was having a
      violet-ray facial treatment, the next an oil shampoo. Boys wheeled about
      miraculous electrical massage-machines. The barbers snatched steaming
      towels from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and disdainfully
      flung them away after a second's use. On the vast marble shelf facing the
      chairs were hundreds of tonics, amber and ruby and emerald. It was
      flattering to Babbitt to have two personal slaves at once&mdash;the barber
      and the bootblack. He would have been completely happy if he could also
      have had the manicure girl. The barber snipped at his hair and asked his
      opinion of the Havre de Grace races, the baseball season, and Mayor Prout.
      The young negro bootblack hummed &ldquo;The Camp Meeting Blues&rdquo; and polished in
      rhythm to his tune, drawing the shiny shoe-rag so taut at each stroke that
      it snapped like a banjo string. The barber was an excellent salesman. He
      made Babbitt feel rich and important by his manner of inquiring, &ldquo;What is
      your favorite tonic, sir? Have you time to-day, sir, for a facial massage?
      Your scalp is a little tight; shall I give you a scalp massage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's best thrill was in the shampoo. The barber made his hair creamy
      with thick soap, then (as Babbitt bent over the bowl, muffled in towels)
      drenched it with hot water which prickled along his scalp, and at last ran
      the water ice-cold. At the shock, the sudden burning cold on his skull,
      Babbitt's heart thumped, his chest heaved, and his spine was an electric
      wire. It was a sensation which broke the monotony of life. He looked
      grandly about the shop as he sat up. The barber obsequiously rubbed his
      wet hair and bound it in a towel as in a turban, so that Babbitt resembled
      a plump pink calif on an ingenious and adjustable throne. The barber
      begged (in the manner of one who was a good fellow yet was overwhelmed by
      the splendors of the calif), &ldquo;How about a little Eldorado Oil Rub, sir?
      Very beneficial to the scalp, sir. Didn't I give you one the last time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hadn't, but Babbitt agreed, &ldquo;Well, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With quaking eagerness he saw that his manicure girl was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, I guess I'll have a manicure after all,&rdquo; he droned, and
      excitedly watched her coming, dark-haired, smiling, tender, little. The
      manicuring would have to be finished at her table, and he would be able to
      talk to her without the barber listening. He waited contentedly, not
      trying to peep at her, while she filed his nails and the barber shaved him
      and smeared on his burning cheeks all the interesting mixtures which the
      pleasant minds of barbers have devised through the revolving ages. When
      the barber was done and he sat opposite the girl at her table, he admired
      the marble slab of it, admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny silver
      taps, and admired himself for being able to frequent so costly a place.
      When she withdrew his wet hand from the bowl, it was so sensitive from the
      warm soapy water that he was abnormally aware of the clasp of her firm
      little paw. He delighted in the pinkness and glossiness of her nails. Her
      hands seemed to him more adorable than Mrs. Judique's thin fingers, and
      more elegant. He had a certain ecstasy in the pain when she gnawed at the
      cuticle of his nails with a sharp knife. He struggled not to look at the
      outline of her young bosom and her shoulders, the more apparent under a
      film of pink chiffon. He was conscious of her as an exquisite thing, and
      when he tried to impress his personality on her he spoke as awkwardly as a
      country boy at his first party:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, kinda hot to be working to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is hot. You cut your own nails, last time, didn't you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, guess I must 've.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always ought to go to a manicure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, maybe that's so. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing looks so nice as nails that are looked after good. I
      always think that's the best way to spot a real gent. There was an auto
      salesman in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellow's
      class by the car he drove, but I says to him, 'Don't be silly,' I says;
      'the wisenheimers grab a look at a fellow's nails when they want to tell
      if he's a tin-horn or a real gent!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, maybe there's something to that. Course, that is&mdash;with a pretty
      kiddy like you, a man can't help coming to get his mitts done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh, I may be a kid, but I'm a wise bird, and I know nice folks when I
      see um&mdash;I can read character at a glance&mdash;and I'd never talk so
      frank with a fellow if I couldn't see he was a nice fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. Her eyes seemed to him as gentle as April pools. With great
      seriousness he informed himself that &ldquo;there were some roughnecks who would
      think that just because a girl was a manicure girl and maybe not awful
      well educated, she was no good, but as for him, he was a democrat, and
      understood people,&rdquo; and he stood by the assertion that this was a fine
      girl, a good girl&mdash;but not too uncomfortably good. He inquired in a
      voice quick with sympathy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have a lot of fellows who try to get fresh with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, gee, do I! Say, listen, there's some of these cigar-store sports
      that think because a girl's working in a barber shop, they can get away
      with anything. The things they saaaaaay! But, believe me, I know how to
      hop those birds! I just give um the north and south and ask um, 'Say, who
      do you think you're talking to?' and they fade away like love's young
      nightmare and oh, don't you want a box of nail-paste? It will keep the
      nails as shiny as when first manicured, harmless to apply and lasts for
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I'll try some. Say&mdash;Say, it's funny; I've been coming here
      ever since the shop opened and&mdash;&rdquo; With arch surprise. &ldquo;&mdash;I don't
      believe I know your name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you? My, that's funny! I don't know yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you quit kidding me! What's the nice little name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain't so darn nice. I guess it's kind of kike. But my folks ain't
      kikes. My papa's papa was a nobleman in Poland, and there was a gentleman
      in here one day, he was kind of a count or something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of a no-account, I guess you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's telling this, smarty? And he said he knew my papa's papa's folks in
      Poland and they had a dandy big house. Right on a lake!&rdquo; Doubtfully,
      &ldquo;Maybe you don't believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. No. Really. Sure I do. Why not? Don't think I'm kidding you, honey,
      but every time I've noticed you I've said to myself, 'That kid has Blue
      Blood in her veins!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest I did. Well, well, come on&mdash;now we're friends&mdash;what's
      the darling little name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ida Putiak. It ain't so much-a-much of a name. I always say to Ma, I say,
      'Ma, why didn't you name me Doloress or something with some class to it?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I think it's a scrumptious name. Ida!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet I know your name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, not necessarily. Of course&mdash;Oh, it isn't so specially
      well known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you Mr. Sondheim that travels for the Krackajack Kitchen Kutlery
      Ko.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not! I'm Mr. Babbitt, the real-estate broker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me! Oh, of course. You mean here in Zenith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; With the briskness of one whose feelings have been hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure. I've read your ads. They're swell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um, well&mdash;You might have read about my speeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I have! I don't get much time to read but&mdash;I guess you think
      I'm an awfully silly little nit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you're a little darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;There's one nice thing about this job. It gives a girl a
      chance to meet some awfully nice gentlemen and improve her mind with
      conversation, and you get so you can read a guy's character at the first
      glance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Ida; please don't think I'm getting fresh&mdash;&rdquo; He was hotly
      reflecting that it would be humiliating to be rejected by this child, and
      dangerous to be accepted. If he took her to dinner, if he were seen by
      censorious friends&mdash;But he went on ardently: &ldquo;Don't think I'm getting
      fresh if I suggest it would be nice for us to go out and have a little
      dinner together some evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as I ought to but&mdash;My gentleman-friend's always wanting
      to take me out. But maybe I could to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason, he assured himself, why he shouldn't have a quiet
      dinner with a poor girl who would benefit by association with an educated
      and mature person like himself. But, lest some one see them and not
      understand, he would take her to Biddlemeier's Inn, on the outskirts of
      the city. They would have a pleasant drive, this hot lonely evening, and
      he might hold her hand&mdash;no, he wouldn't even do that. Ida was
      complaisant; her bare shoulders showed it only too clearly; but he'd be
      hanged if he'd make love to her merely because she expected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his car broke down; something had happened to the ignition. And he
      HAD to have the car this evening! Furiously he tested the spark-plugs,
      stared at the commutator. His angriest glower did not seem to stir the
      sulky car, and in disgrace it was hauled off to a garage. With a renewed
      thrill he thought of a taxicab. There was something at once wealthy and
      interestingly wicked about a taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he met her, on a corner two blocks from the Hotel Thornleigh, she
      said, &ldquo;A taxi? Why, I thought you owned a car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Of course I do! But it's out of commission to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she remarked, as one who had heard that tale before.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way out to Biddlemeier's Inn he tried to talk as an old friend,
      but he could not pierce the wall of her words. With interminable
      indignation she narrated her retorts to &ldquo;that fresh head-barber&rdquo; and the
      drastic things she would do to him if he persisted in saying that she was
      &ldquo;better at gassing than at hoof-paring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Biddlemeier's Inn they were unable to get anything to drink. The
      head-waiter refused to understand who George F. Babbitt was. They sat
      steaming before a vast mixed grill, and made conversation about baseball.
      When he tried to hold Ida's hand she said with bright friendliness,
      &ldquo;Careful! That fresh waiter is rubbering.&rdquo; But they came out into a
      treacherous summer night, the air lazy and a little moon above
      transfigured maples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's drive some other place, where we can get a drink and dance!&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, some other night. But I promised Ma I'd be home early to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats! It's too nice to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd just love to, but Ma would give me fits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was trembling. She was everything that was young and exquisite. He put
      his arm about her. She snuggled against his shoulder, unafraid, and he was
      triumphant. Then she ran down the steps of the Inn, singing, &ldquo;Come on,
      Georgie, we'll have a nice drive and get cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a night of lovers. All along the highway into Zenith, under the low
      and gentle moon, motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in
      revery. He held out hungry hands to Ida, and when she patted them he was
      grateful. There was no sense of struggle and transition; he kissed her and
      simply she responded to his kiss, they two behind the stolid back of the
      chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hat fell off, and she broke from his embrace to reach for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let it be!&rdquo; he implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh? My hat? Not a chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited till she had pinned it on, then his arm sank about her. She drew
      away from it, and said with maternal soothing, &ldquo;Now, don't be a silly boy!
      Mustn't make Ittle Mama scold! Just sit back, dearie, and see what a swell
      night it is. If you're a good boy, maybe I'll kiss you when we say
      nighty-night. Now give me a cigarette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to her
      comfort. Then he sat as far from her as possible. He was cold with
      failure. No one could have told Babbitt that he was a fool with more
      vigor, precision, and intelligence than he himself displayed. He reflected
      that from the standpoint of the Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew he was a
      wicked man, and from the standpoint of Miss Ida Putiak, an old bore who
      had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearie, you aren't going to go and get peevish, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke pertly. He wanted to spank her. He brooded, &ldquo;I don't have to
      take anything off this gutter-pup! Darn immigrant! Well, let's get it over
      as quick as we can, and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest of the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snorted, &ldquo;Huh? Me peevish? Why, you baby, why should I be peevish? Now,
      listen, Ida; listen to Uncle George. I want to put you wise about this
      scrapping with your head-barber all the time. I've had a lot of experience
      with employees, and let me tell you it doesn't pay to antagonize&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the drab wooden house in which she lived he said good-night briefly and
      amiably, but as the taxicab drove off he was praying &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HE awoke to stretch cheerfully as he listened to the sparrows, then to
      remember that everything was wrong; that he was determined to go astray,
      and not in the least enjoying the process. Why, he wondered, should he be
      in rebellion? What was it all about? &ldquo;Why not be sensible; stop all this
      idiotic running around, and enjoy himself with his family, his business,
      the fellows at the club?&rdquo; What was he getting out of rebellion? Misery and
      shame&mdash;the shame of being treated as an offensive small boy by a
      ragamuffin like Ida Putiak! And yet&mdash;Always he came back to &ldquo;And
      yet.&rdquo; Whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with a world
      which, once doubted, became absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, he assured himself, he was &ldquo;through with this chasing after girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By noontime he was not so sure even of that. If in Miss McGoun, Louetta
      Swanson, and Ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did
      not prove that she did not exist. He was hunted by the ancient thought
      that somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand him,
      value him, and make him happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt returned in August.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her previous absences he had missed her reassuring buzz and of her
      arrival he had made a fête. Now, though he dared not hurt her by letting a
      hint of it appear in his letters, he was sorry that she was coming before
      he had found himself, and he was embarrassed by the need of meeting her
      and looking joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loitered down to the station; he studied the summer-resort posters,
      lest he have to speak to acquaintances and expose his uneasiness. But he
      was well trained. When the train clanked in he was out on the cement
      platform, peering into the chair-cars, and as he saw her in the line of
      passengers moving toward the vestibule he waved his hat. At the door he
      embraced her, and announced, &ldquo;Well, well, well, well, by golly, you look
      fine, you look fine.&rdquo; Then he was aware of Tinka. Here was something, this
      child with her absurd little nose and lively eyes, that loved him,
      believed him great, and as he clasped her, lifted and held her till she
      squealed, he was for the moment come back to his old steady self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinka sat beside him in the car, with one hand on the steering-wheel,
      pretending to help him drive, and he shouted back to his wife, &ldquo;I'll bet
      the kid will be the best chuffer in the family! She holds the wheel like
      an old professional!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the while he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his
      wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      There was about the house an unofficial theory that he was to take his
      vacation alone, to spend a week or ten days in Catawba, but he was nagged
      by the memory that a year ago he had been with Paul in Maine. He saw
      himself returning; finding peace there, and the presence of Paul, in a
      life primitive and heroic. Like a shock came the thought that he actually
      could go. Only, he couldn't, really; he couldn't leave his business, and
      &ldquo;Myra would think it sort of funny, his going way off there alone. Course
      he'd decided to do whatever he darned pleased, from now on, but still&mdash;to
      go way off to Maine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went, after lengthy meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his wife, since it was inconceivable to explain that he was going to
      seek Paul's spirit in the wilderness, he frugally employed the lie
      prepared over a year ago and scarcely used at all. He said that he had to
      see a man in New York on business. He could not have explained even to
      himself why he drew from the bank several hundred dollars more than he
      needed, nor why he kissed Tinka so tenderly, and cried, &ldquo;God bless you,
      baby!&rdquo; From the train he waved to her till she was but a scarlet spot
      beside the brown bulkier presence of Mrs. Babbitt, at the end of a steel
      and cement aisle ending in vast barred gates. With melancholy he looked
      back at the last suburb of Zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way north he pictured the Maine guides: simple and strong and
      daring, jolly as they played stud-poker in their unceiled shack, wise in
      woodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids. He particularly
      remembered Joe Paradise, half Yankee, half Indian. If he could but take up
      a backwoods claim with a man like Joe, work hard with his hands, be free
      and noisy in a flannel shirt, and never come back to this dull decency!
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, like a trapper in a Northern Canada movie, plunge through the forest,
      make camp in the Rockies, a grim and wordless caveman! Why not? He COULD
      do it! There'd be enough money at home for the family to live on till
      Verona was married and Ted self-supporting. Old Henry T. would look out
      for them. Honestly! Why NOT? Really LIVE&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed for it, admitted that he longed for it, then almost believed
      that he was going to do it. Whenever common sense snorted, &ldquo;Nonsense!
      Folks don't run away from decent families and partners; just simply don't
      do it, that's all!&rdquo; then Babbitt answered pleadingly, &ldquo;Well, it wouldn't
      take any more nerve than for Paul to go to jail and&mdash;Lord, how I'd'
*       like to do it! Moccasins&mdash;six-gun&mdash;frontier town&mdash;gamblers&mdash;sleep under
      the stars&mdash;be a regular man, with he-men like Joe Paradise&mdash;gosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he came to Maine, again stood on the wharf before the camp-hotel, again
      spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water, while the pines
      rustled, the mountains glowed, and a trout leaped and fell in a sliding
      circle. He hurried to the guides' shack as to his real home, his real
      friends, long missed. They would be glad to see him. They would stand up
      and shout? &ldquo;Why, here's Mr. Babbitt! He ain't one of these ordinary
      sports! He's a real guy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In their boarded and rather littered cabin the guides sat about the greasy
      table playing stud-poker with greasy cards: half a dozen wrinkled men in
      old trousers and easy old felt hats. They glanced up and nodded. Joe
      Paradise, the swart aging man with the big mustache, grunted, &ldquo;How do.
      Back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence, except for the clatter of chips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt stood beside them, very lonely. He hinted, after a period of
      highly concentrated playing, &ldquo;Guess I might take a hand, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Sit in. How many chips you want? Let's see; you were here with your
      wife, last year, wa'n't you?&rdquo; said Joe Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all of Babbitt's welcome to the old home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played for half an hour before he spoke again. His head was reeking
      with the smoke of pipes and cheap cigars, and he was weary of pairs and
      four-flushes, resentful of the way in which they ignored him. He flung at
      Joe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to guide me for a few days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, jus' soon. I ain't engaged till next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only thus did Joe recognize the friendship Babbitt was offering him.
      Babbitt paid up his losses and left the shack rather childishly. Joe
      raised his head from the coils of smoke like a seal rising from surf,
      grunted, &ldquo;I'll come 'round t'morrow,&rdquo; and dived down to his three aces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither in his voiceless cabin, fragrant with planks of new-cut pine, nor
      along the lake, nor in the sunset clouds which presently eddied behind the
      lavender-misted mountains, could Babbitt find the spirit of Paul as a
      reassuring presence. He was so lonely that after supper he stopped to talk
      with an ancient old lady, a gasping and steadily discoursing old lady, by
      the stove in the hotel-office. He told her of Ted's presumable future
      triumphs in the State University and of Tinka's remarkable vocabulary till
      he was homesick for the home he had left forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the darkness, through that Northern pine-walled silence, he
      blundered down to the lake-front and found a canoe. There were no paddles
      in it but with a board, sitting awkwardly amidships and poking at the
      water rather than paddling, he made his way far out on the lake. The
      lights of the hotel and the cottages became yellow dots, a cluster of
      glow-worms at the base of Sachem Mountain. Larger and ever more
      imperturbable was the mountain in the star-filtered darkness, and the lake
      a limitless pavement of black marble. He was dwarfed and dumb and a little
      awed, but that insignificance freed him from the pomposities of being Mr.
      George F. Babbitt of Zenith; saddened and freed his heart. Now he was
      conscious of the presence of Paul, fancied him (rescued from prison, from
      Zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the tar-roofing business) playing his
      violin at the end of the canoe. He vowed, &ldquo;I will go on! I'll never go
      back! Now that Paul's out of it, I don't want to see any of those damn
      people again! I was a fool to get sore because Joe Paradise didn't jump up
      and hug me. He's one of these woodsmen; too wise to go yelping and talking
      your arm off like a cityman. But get him back in the mountains, out on the
      trail&mdash;! That's real living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe reported at Babbitt's cabin at nine the next morning. Babbitt greeted
      him as a fellow caveman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe, how d' you feel about hitting the trail, and getting away from
      these darn soft summerites and these women and all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say we go over to Box Car Pond&mdash;they tell me the shack
      there isn't being used&mdash;and camp out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right, Mr. Babbitt, but it's nearer to Skowtuit Pond, and you
      can get just about as good fishing there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want to get into the real wilds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll put the old packs on our backs and get into the woods and really
      hike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think maybe it would be easier to go by water, through Lake Chogue. We
      can go all the way by motor boat&mdash;flat-bottom boat with an Evinrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! Bust up the quiet with a chugging motor? Not on your life! You
      just throw a pair of socks in the old pack, and tell 'em what you want for
      eats. I'll be ready soon 's you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of the sports go by boat, Mr. Babbitt. It's a long walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Joe: are you objecting to walking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I guess I can do it. But I haven't tramped that far for sixteen
      years. Most of the sports go by boat. But I can do it if you say so&mdash;I
      guess.&rdquo; Joe walked away in sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had recovered from his touchy wrath before Joe returned. He
      pictured him as warming up and telling the most entertaining stories. But
      Joe had not yet warmed up when they took the trail. He persistently kept
      behind Babbitt, and however much his shoulders ached from the pack,
      however sorely he panted, Babbitt could hear his guide panting equally.
      But the trail was satisfying: a path brown with pine-needles and rough
      with roots, among the balsams, the ferns, the sudden groves of white
      birch. He became credulous again, and rejoiced in sweating. When he
      stopped to rest he chuckled, &ldquo;Guess we're hitting it up pretty good for a
      couple o' old birds, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh,&rdquo; admitted Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a mighty pretty place. Look, you can see the lake down through
      the trees. I tell you, Joe, you don't appreciate how lucky you are to live
      in woods like this, instead of a city with trolleys grinding and
      typewriters clacking and people bothering the life out of you all the
      time! I wish I knew the woods like you do. Say, what's the name of that
      little red flower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rubbing his back, Joe regarded the flower resentfully &ldquo;Well, some folks
      call it one thing and some calls it another I always just call it Pink
      Flower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt blessedly ceased thinking as tramping turned into blind plodding.
      He was submerged in weariness. His plump legs seemed to go on by
      themselves, without guidance, and he mechanically wiped away the sweat
      which stung his eyes. He was too tired to be consciously glad as, after a
      sun-scourged mile of corduroy tote-road through a swamp where flies
      hovered over a hot waste of brush, they reached the cool shore of Box Car
      Pond. When he lifted the pack from his back he staggered from the change
      in balance, and for a moment could not stand erect. He lay beneath an
      ample-bosomed maple tree near the guest-shack, and joyously felt sleep
      running through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke toward dusk, to find Joe efficiently cooking bacon and eggs and
      flapjacks for supper, and his admiration of the woodsman returned. He sat
      on a stump and felt virile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, what would you do if you had a lot of money? Would you stick to
      guiding, or would you take a claim 'way back in the woods and be
      independent of people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Joe brightened. He chewed his cud a second, and
      bubbled, &ldquo;I've often thought of that! If I had the money, I'd go down to
      Tinker's Falls and open a swell shoe store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After supper Joe proposed a game of stud-poker but Babbitt refused with
      brevity, and Joe contentedly went to bed at eight. Babbitt sat on the
      stump, facing the dark pond, slapping mosquitos. Save the snoring guide,
      there was no other human being within ten miles. He was lonelier than he
      had ever been in his life. Then he was in Zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was worrying as to whether Miss McGoun wasn't paying too much for
      carbon paper. He was at once resenting and missing the persistent teasing
      at the Roughnecks' Table. He was wondering what Zilla Riesling was doing
      now. He was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity of being a
      garageman, Ted would &ldquo;get busy&rdquo; in the university. He was thinking of his
      wife. &ldquo;If she would only&mdash;if she wouldn't be so darn satisfied with
      just settling down&mdash;No! I won't! I won't go back! I'll be fifty in
      three years. Sixty in thirteen years. I'm going to have some fun before
      it's too late. I don't care! I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought of Ida Putiak, of Louetta Swanson, of that nice widow&mdash;what
      was her name?&mdash;Tanis Judique?&mdash;the one for whom he'd found the
      flat. He was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, I can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never
      run away from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment he started for Zenith. In his journey there was no appearance
      of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was on the
      Zenith train. He knew that he was slinking back not because it was what he
      longed to do but because it was all he could do. He scanned again his
      discovery that he could never run away from Zenith and family and office,
      because in his own brain he bore the office and the family and every
      street and disquiet and illusion of Zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm going to&mdash;oh, I'm going to start something!&rdquo; he vowed, and
      he tried to make it valiant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      As he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces, he saw only
      one person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer who, after
      the blessings of being in Babbitt's own class at college and of becoming a
      corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed farmer-labor tickets and
      fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he was in rebellion,
      naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic, but
      in all the Pullmans he could find no other acquaintance, and reluctantly
      he halted. Seneca Doane was a slight, thin-haired man, rather like Chum
      Frink except that he hadn't Frink's grin. He was reading a book called
      &ldquo;The Way of All Flesh.&rdquo; It looked religious to Babbitt, and he wondered if
      Doane could possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hello, Doane,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked up. His voice was curiously kind. &ldquo;Oh! How do, Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been away, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've been in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington, eh? How's the old Government making out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Don't care if I do. Well, well! Been quite a while since I've had
      a good chance to talk to you, Doane. I was, uh&mdash;Sorry you didn't turn
      up at the last class-dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the unions coming? Going to run for mayor again?&rdquo; Doane seemed
      restless. He was fingering the pages of his book. He said &ldquo;I might&rdquo; as
      though it didn't mean anything in particular, and he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt liked that smile, and hunted for conversation: &ldquo;Saw a bang-up
      cabaret in New York: the 'Good-Morning Cutie' bunch at the Hotel Minton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they're pretty girls. I danced there one evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Like dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. I like dancing and pretty women and good food better than
      anything else in the world. Most men do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But gosh, Doane, I thought you fellows wanted to take all the good eats
      and everything away from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not at all. What I'd like to see is the meetings of the Garment
      Workers held at the Ritz, with a dance afterward. Isn't that reasonable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, might be good idea, all right. Well&mdash;Shame I haven't seen more
      of you, recent years. Oh, say, hope you haven't held it against me, my
      bucking you as mayor, going on the stump for Prout. You see, I'm an
      organization Republican, and I kind of felt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no reason why you shouldn't fight me. I have no doubt you're good
      for the Organization. I remember&mdash;in college you were an unusually
      liberal, sensitive chap. I can still recall your saying to me that you
      were going to be a lawyer, and take the cases of the poor for nothing, and
      fight the rich. And I remember I said I was going to be one of the rich
      myself, and buy paintings and live at Newport. I'm sure you inspired us
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.... Well.... I've always aimed to be liberal.&rdquo; Babbitt was
      enormously shy and proud and self-conscious; he tried to look like the boy
      he had been a quarter-century ago, and he shone upon his old friend Seneca
      Doane as he rumbled, &ldquo;Trouble with a lot of these fellows, even the live
      wires and some of 'em that think they're forward-looking, is they aren't
      broad-minded and liberal. Now, I always believe in giving the other fellow
      a chance, and listening to his ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you how I figure it: A little opposition is good for all of us, so a
      fellow, especially if he's a business man and engaged in doing the work of
      the world, ought to be liberal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always say a fellow ought to have Vision and Ideals. I guess some of
      the fellows in my business think I'm pretty visionary, but I just let 'em
      think what they want to and go right on&mdash;same as you do.... By golly,
      this is nice to have a chance to sit and visit and kind of, you might say,
      brush up on our ideals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course we visionaries do rather get beaten. Doesn't it bother
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit! Nobody can dictate to me what I think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the man I want to help me. I want you to talk to some of the
      business men and try to make them a little more liberal in their attitude
      toward poor Beecher Ingram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ingram? But, why, he's this nut preacher that got kicked out of the
      Congregationalist Church, isn't he, and preaches free love and sedition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, Doane explained, was indeed the general conception of Beecher
      Ingram, but he himself saw Beecher Ingram as a priest of the brotherhood
      of man, of which Babbitt was notoriously an upholder. So would Babbitt
      keep his acquaintances from hounding Ingram and his forlorn little church?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! I'll call down any of the boys I hear getting funny about
      Ingram,&rdquo; Babbitt said affectionately to his dear friend Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane warmed up and became reminiscent. He spoke of student days in
      Germany, of lobbying for single tax in Washington, of international labor
      conferences. He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel Wedgwood,
      Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane associated only
      with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who knew Lord
      Wycombes by the score, and he got in two references to Sir Gerald Doak. He
      felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla Riesling,
      and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters' Club never
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife how hot it was
      in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with ideas and
      forgiveness. He'd get Paul released; he'd do things, vague but highly
      benevolent things, for Zilla; he'd be as generous as his friend Seneca
      Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her
      as buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to her
      boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale district,
      he stopped in discomfort. At an upper window, leaning on her elbow, was a
      woman with the features of Zilla, but she was bloodless and aged, like a
      yellowed wad of old paper crumpled into wrinkles. Where Zilla had bounced
      and jiggled, this woman was dreadfully still.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited half an hour before she came into the boarding-house parlor.
      Fifty times he opened the book of photographs of the Chicago World's Fair
      of 1893, fifty times he looked at the picture of the Court of Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled to find Zilla in the room. She wore a black streaky gown
      which she had tried to brighten with a girdle of crimson ribbon. The
      ribbon had been torn and patiently mended. He noted this carefully,
      because he did not wish to look at her shoulders. One shoulder was lower
      than the other; one arm she carried in contorted fashion, as though it
      were paralyzed; and behind a high collar of cheap lace there was a gouge
      in the anemic neck which had once been shining and softly plump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, old Zilla! By golly, it's good to see you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can send his messages through a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, rats, Zilla, I didn't come just because of him. Came as an old
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You waited long enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know how it is. Figured you wouldn't want to see a friend of
      his for quite some time and&mdash;Sit down, honey! Let's be sensible.
      We've all of us done a bunch of things that we hadn't ought to, but maybe
      we can sort of start over again. Honest, Zilla, I'd like to do something
      to make you both happy. Know what I thought to-day? Mind you, Paul doesn't
      know a thing about this&mdash;doesn't know I was going to come see you. I
      got to thinking: Zilla's a fine? big-hearted woman, and she'll understand
      that, uh, Paul's had his lesson now. Why wouldn't it be a fine idea if you
      asked the governor to pardon him? Believe he would, if it came from you.
      No! Wait! Just think how good you'd feel if you were generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I wish to be generous.&rdquo; She was sitting primly, speaking icily. &ldquo;For
      that reason I wish to keep him in prison, as an example to evil-doers.
      I've gotten religion, George, since the terrible thing that man did to me.
      Sometimes I used to be unkind, and I wished for worldly pleasures, for
      dancing and the theater. But when I was in the hospital the pastor of the
      Pentecostal Communion Faith used to come to see me, and he showed me,
      right from the prophecies written in the Word of God, that the Day of
      Judgment is coming and all the members of the older churches are going
      straight to eternal damnation, because they only do lip-service and
      swallow the world, the flesh, and the devil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For fifteen wild minutes she talked, pouring out admonitions to flee the
      wrath to come, and her face flushed, her dead voice recaptured something
      of the shrill energy of the old Zilla. She wound up with a furious:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the blessing of God himself that Paul should be in prison now, and
      torn and humbled by punishment, so that he may yet save his soul, and so
      other wicked men, these horrible chasers after women and lust, may have an
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt had itched and twisted. As in church he dared not move during the
      sermon so now he felt that he must seem attentive, though her screeching
      denunciations flew past him like carrion birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to be calm and brotherly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, Zilla. But gosh, it certainly is the essence of religion to
      be charitable, isn't it? Let me tell you how I figure it: What we need in
      the world is liberalism, liberality, if we're going to get anywhere. I've
      always believed in being broad-minded and liberal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Liberal?&rdquo; It was very much the old Zilla. &ldquo;Why, George Babbitt,
      you're about as broad-minded and liberal as a razor-blade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am, am I! Well, just let me tell you, just&mdash;let me&mdash;tell&mdash;you,
      I'm as by golly liberal as you are religious, anyway! YOU RELIGIOUS!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so! Our pastor says I sustain him in the faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet you do! With Paul's money! But just to show you how liberal I
      am, I'm going to send a check for ten bucks to this Beecher Ingram,
      because a lot of fellows are saying the poor cuss preaches sedition and
      free love, and they're trying to run him out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they're right! They ought to run him out of town! Why, he preaches&mdash;if
      you can call it preaching&mdash;in a theater, in the House of Satan! You
      don't know what it is to find God, to find peace, to behold the snares
      that the devil spreads out for our feet. Oh, I'm so glad to see the
      mysterious purposes of God in having Paul harm me and stop my wickedness&mdash;and
      Paul's getting his, good and plenty, for the cruel things he did to me,
      and I hope he DIES in prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, &ldquo;Well, if that's what you call
      being at peace, for heaven's sake just warn me before you go to war, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Vast is the power of cities to reclaim the wanderer. More than mountains
      or the shore-devouring sea, a city retains its character, imperturbable,
      cynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose. Though
      Babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with Joe Paradise in the
      wilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite sure,
      on the night before he reached Zenith, that neither he nor the city would
      be the same again, ten days after his return he could not believe that he
      had ever been away. Nor was it at all evident to his acquaintances that
      there was a new George F. Babbitt, save that he was more irritable under
      the incessant chaffing at the Athletic Club, and once, when Vergil Gunch
      observed that Seneca Doane ought to be hanged, Babbitt snorted, &ldquo;Oh, rats,
      he's not so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At home he grunted &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,
      and was delighted by Tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, &ldquo;No
      class to that corrugated iron garage. Have to build me a nice frame one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verona and Kenneth Escott appeared really to be engaged. In his newspaper
      Escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against commission-houses. As a
      result he had been given an excellent job in a commission-house, and he
      was making a salary on which he could marry, and denouncing irresponsible
      reporters who wrote stories criticizing commission-houses without knowing
      what they were talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      This September Ted had entered the State University as a freshman in the
      College of Arts and Sciences. The university was at Mohalis only fifteen
      miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end. Babbitt was
      worried. Ted was &ldquo;going in for&rdquo; everything but books. He had tried to
      &ldquo;make&rdquo; the football team as a light half-back, he was looking forward to
      the basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the Freshman Hop, and
      (as a Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he was being &ldquo;rushed&rdquo; by
      two fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could learn nothing save a
      mumbled, &ldquo;Oh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of
      junk about literature and economics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One week-end Ted proposed, &ldquo;Say, Dad, why can't I transfer over from the
      College to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering? You
      always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Engineering School hasn't got the standing the College has,&rdquo;
       fretted Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to know how it hasn't! The Engineers can play on any of the
      teams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much explanation of the &ldquo;dollars-and-cents value of being known
      as a college man when you go into the law,&rdquo; and a truly oratorical account
      of the lawyer's life. Before he was through with it, Babbitt had Ted a
      United States Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was Seneca Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, gee whiz,&rdquo; Ted marveled, &ldquo;I thought you always said this Doane was a
      reg'lar nut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no way to speak of a great man! Doane's always been a good friend
      of mine&mdash;fact I helped him in college&mdash;I started him out and you
      might say inspired him. Just because he's sympathetic with the aims of
      Labor, a lot of chumps that lack liberality and broad-mindedness think
      he's a crank, but let me tell you there's mighty few of 'em that rake in
      the fees he does, and he's a friend of some of the strongest; most
      conservative men in the world&mdash;like Lord Wycombe, this, uh, this big
      English nobleman that's so well known. And you now, which would you rather
      do: be in with a lot of greasy mechanics and laboring-men, or chum up to a
      real fellow like Lord Wycombe, and get invited to his house for parties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;gosh,&rdquo; sighed Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next week-end he came in joyously with, &ldquo;Say, Dad, why couldn't I take
      mining engineering instead of the academic course? You talk about standing&mdash;maybe
      there isn't much in mechanical engineering, but the Miners, gee, they got
      seven out of eleven in the new elections to Nu Tau Tau!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE strike which turned Zenith into two belligerent camps; white and red,
      began late in September with a walk-out of telephone girls and linemen, in
      protest against a reduction of wages. The newly formed union of
      dairy-products workers went out, partly in sympathy and partly in demand
      for a forty-four hour week. They were followed by the truck-drivers'
      union. Industry was tied up, and the whole city was nervous with talk of a
      trolley strike, a printers' strike, a general strike. Furious citizens,
      trying to get telephone calls through strike-breaking girls, danced
      helplessly. Every truck that made its way from the factories to the
      freight-stations was guarded by a policeman, trying to look stoical beside
      the scab driver. A line of fifty trucks from the Zenith Steel and
      Machinery Company was attacked by strikers-rushing out from the sidewalk,
      pulling drivers from the seats, smashing carburetors and commutators,
      while telephone girls cheered from the walk, and small boys heaved bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Guard was ordered out. Colonel Nixon, who in private life was
      Mr. Caleb Nixon, secretary of the Pullmore Tractor Company, put on a long
      khaki coat and stalked through crowds, a .44 automatic in hand. Even
      Babbitt's friend, Clarence Drum the shoe merchant&mdash;a round and merry
      man who told stories at the Athletic Club, and who strangely resembled a
      Victorian pug-dog&mdash;was to be seen as a waddling but ferocious
      captain, with his belt tight about his comfortable little belly, and his
      round little mouth petulant as he piped to chattering groups on corners.
      &ldquo;Move on there now! I can't have any of this loitering!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every newspaper in the city, save one, was against the strikers. When mobs
      raided the news-stands, at each was stationed a militiaman, a young,
      embarrassed citizen-soldier with eye-glasses, bookkeeper or grocery-clerk
      in private life, trying to look dangerous while small boys yelped, &ldquo;Get
      onto de tin soldier!&rdquo; and striking truck-drivers inquired tenderly, &ldquo;Say,
      Joe, when I was fighting in France, was you in camp in the States or was
      you doing Swede exercises in the Y. M. C. A.? Be careful of that bayonet,
      now, or you'll cut yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in Zenith who talked of anything but the strike, and no
      one who did not take sides. You were either a courageous friend of Labor,
      or you were a fearless supporter of the Rights of Property; and in either
      case you were belligerent, and ready to disown any friend who did not hate
      the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A condensed-milk plant was set afire&mdash;each side charged it to the
      other&mdash;and the city was hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he
      agreed that the Crooked Agitators ought to be shot. He was sorry when his
      friend, Seneca Doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of going
      to Doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a
      broadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls had
      been hungry, he was troubled. &ldquo;All lies and fake figures,&rdquo; he said, but in
      a doubtful croak.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Sunday after, the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church announced a
      sermon by Dr. John Jennison Drew on &ldquo;How the Saviour Would End Strikes.&rdquo;
       Babbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went to the
      service, hopeful that Dr. Drew really did have the information as to what
      the divine powers thought about strikes. Beside Babbitt in the large,
      curving, glossy, velvet-upholstered pew was Chum Frink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frink whispered, &ldquo;Hope the doc gives the strikers hell! Ordinarily, I
      don't believe in a preacher butting into political matters&mdash;let him
      stick to straight religion and save souls, and not stir up a lot of
      discussion&mdash;but at a time like this, I do think he ought to stand
      right up and bawl out those plug-uglies to a fare-you-well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; said Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Dr. Drew, his rustic bang flopping with the intensity of his
      poetic and sociologic ardor, trumpeted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the untoward series of industrial dislocations which have&mdash;let
      us be courageous and admit it boldly&mdash;throttled the business life of
      our fair city these past days, there has been a great deal of loose talk
      about scientific prevention of scientific&mdash;SCIENTIFIC! Now, let me
      tell you that the most unscientific thing in the world is science! Take
      the attacks on the established fundamentals of the Christian creed which
      were so popular with the 'scientists' a generation ago. Oh, yes, they were
      mighty fellows, and great poo-bahs of criticism! They were going to
      destroy the church; they were going to prove the world was created and has
      been brought to its extraordinary level of morality and civilization by
      blind chance. Yet the church stands just as firmly to-day as ever, and the
      only answer a Christian pastor needs make to the long-haired opponents of
      his simple faith is just a pitying smile!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now these same 'scientists' want to replace the natural condition of
      free competition by crazy systems which, no matter by what high-sounding
      names they are called, are nothing but a despotic paternalism. Naturally,
      I'm not criticizing labor courts, injunctions against men proven to be
      striking unjustly, or those excellent unions in which the men and the boss
      get together. But I certainly am criticizing the systems in which the free
      and fluid motivation of independent labor is to be replaced by cooked-up
      wage-scales and minimum salaries and government commissions and labor
      federations and all that poppycock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is not generally understood is that this whole industrial matter
      isn't a question of economics. It's essentially and only a matter of Love,
      and of the practical application of the Christian religion! Imagine a
      factory&mdash;instead of committees of workmen alienating the boss, the
      boss goes among them smiling, and they smile back, the elder brother and
      the younger. Brothers, that's what they must be, loving brothers, and then
      strikes would be as inconceivable as hatred in the home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Babbitt muttered, &ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; said Chum Frink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't know what he's talking about. It's just as clear as mud. It
      doesn't mean a darn thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frink looked at him doubtfully, through all the service kept glancing at
      him doubtfully, till Babbitt was nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      The strikers had announced a parade for Tuesday morning, but Colonel Nixon
      had forbidden it, the newspapers said. When Babbitt drove west from his
      office at ten that morning he saw a drove of shabby men heading toward the
      tangled, dirty district beyond Court House Square. He hated them, because
      they were poor, because they made him feel insecure. &ldquo;Damn loafers!
      Wouldn't be common workmen if they had any pep,&rdquo; he complained. He
      wondered if there was going to be a riot. He drove toward the
      starting-point of the parade, a triangle of limp and faded grass known as
      Moore Street Park, and halted his car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park and streets were buzzing with strikers, young men in blue denim
      shirts, old men with caps. Through them, keeping them stirred like a
      boiling pot, moved the militiamen. Babbitt could hear the soldiers'
      monotonous orders: &ldquo;Keep moving&mdash;move on, 'bo&mdash;keep your feet
      warm!&rdquo; Babbitt admired their stolid good temper. The crowd shouted, &ldquo;Tin
      soldiers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dirty dogs&mdash;servants of the capitalists!&rdquo; but the
      militiamen grinned and answered only, &ldquo;Sure, that's right. Keep moving,
      Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt thrilled over the citizen-soldiers, hated the scoundrels who were
      obstructing the pleasant ways of prosperity, admired Colonel Nixon's
      striding contempt for the crowd; and as Captain Clarence Drum, that rather
      puffing shoe-dealer, came raging by, Babbitt respectfully clamored, &ldquo;Great
      work, Captain! Don't let 'em march!&rdquo; He watched the strikers filing from
      the park. Many of them bore posters with &ldquo;They can't stop our peacefully
      walking.&rdquo; The militiamen tore away the posters, but the strikers fell in
      behind their leaders and straggled off, a thin unimpressive trickle
      between steel-glinting lines of soldiers. Babbitt saw with disappointment
      that there wasn't going to be any violence, nothing interesting at all.
      Then he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the marchers, beside a bulky young workman, was Seneca Doane,
      smiling, content. In front of him was Professor Brockbank, head of the
      history department in the State University, an old man and white-bearded,
      known to come from a distinguished Massachusetts family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, gosh,&rdquo; Babbitt marveled, &ldquo;a swell like him in with the strikers? And
      good ole Senny Doane! They're fools to get mixed up with this bunch.
      They're parlor socialists! But they have got nerve. And nothing in it for
      them, not a cent! And&mdash;I don't know 's ALL the strikers look like
      such tough nuts. Look just about like anybody else to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The militiamen were turning the parade down a side street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They got just as much right to march as anybody else! They own the
      streets as much as Clarence Drum or the American Legion does!&rdquo; Babbitt
      grumbled. &ldquo;Of course, they're&mdash;they're a bad element, but&mdash;Oh,
      rats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the Athletic Club, Babbitt was silent during lunch, while the others
      fretted, &ldquo;I don't know what the world's coming to,&rdquo; or solaced their
      spirits with &ldquo;kidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Clarence Drum came swinging by, splendid in khaki.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's it going, Captain?&rdquo; inquired Vergil Gunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we got 'em stopped. We worked 'em off on side streets and separated
      'em and they got discouraged and went home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine work. No violence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine work nothing!&rdquo; groaned Mr. Drum. &ldquo;If I had my way, there'd be a
      whole lot of violence, and I'd start it, and then the whole thing would be
      over. I don't believe in standing back and wet-nursing these fellows and
      letting the disturbances drag on. I tell you these strikers are nothing in
      God's world but a lot of bomb-throwing socialists and thugs, and the only
      way to handle 'em is with a club! That's what I'd do; beat up the whole
      lot of 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt heard himself saying, &ldquo;Oh, rats, Clarence, they look just about
      like you and me, and I certainly didn't notice any bombs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drum complained, &ldquo;Oh, you didn't, eh? Well, maybe you'd like to take
      charge of the strike! Just tell Colonel Nixon what innocents the strikers
      are! He'd be glad to hear about it!&rdquo; Drum strode on, while all the table
      stared at Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the idea? Do you want us to give those hell-hounds love and
      kisses, or what?&rdquo; said Orville Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you defend a lot of hoodlums that are trying to take the bread and
      butter away from our families?&rdquo; raged Professor Pumphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vergil Gunch intimidatingly said nothing. He put on sternness like a mask;
      his jaw was hard, his bristly short hair seemed cruel, his silence was a
      ferocious thunder. While the others assured Babbitt that they must have
      misunderstood him, Gunch looked as though he had understood only too well.
      Like a robed judge he listened to Babbitt's stammering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sure; course they're a bunch of toughs. But I just mean&mdash;Strikes
      me it's bad policy to talk about clubbing 'em. Cabe Nixon doesn't. He's
      got the fine Italian hand. And that's why he's colonel. Clarence Drum is
      jealous of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Professor Pumphrey, &ldquo;you hurt Clarence's feelings, George.
      He's been out there all morning getting hot and dusty, and no wonder he
      wants to beat the tar out of those sons of guns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gunch said nothing, and watched; and Babbitt knew that he was being
      watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was leaving the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink protesting to Gunch, &ldquo;&mdash;don't
      know what's got into him. Last Sunday Doc Drew preached a corking sermon
      about decency in business and Babbitt kicked about that, too. Near 's I
      can figure out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was vaguely frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the rostrum of a
      kitchen-chair. He stopped his car. From newspaper pictures he knew that
      the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, Beecher Ingram, of
      whom Seneca Doane had spoken. Ingram was a gaunt man with flamboyant hair,
      weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. He was pleading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day,
      doing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought
      to be able&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt saw that from the sidewalk Vergil Gunch was watching him. In vague
      disquiet he started the car and mechanically drove on, while Gunch's
      hostile eyes seemed to follow him all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a lot of these fellows,&rdquo; Babbitt was complaining to his wife,
      &ldquo;that think if workmen go on strike they're a regular bunch of fiends.
      Now, of course, it's a fight between sound business and the destructive
      element, and we got to lick the stuffin's out of 'em when they challenge
      us, but doggoned if I see why we can't fight like gentlemen and not go
      calling 'em dirty dogs and saying they ought to be shot down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George,&rdquo; she said placidly, &ldquo;I thought you always insisted that all
      strikers ought to be put in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did! Well, I mean&mdash;Some of 'em, of course. Irresponsible
      leaders. But I mean a fellow ought to be broad-minded and liberal about
      things like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dearie, I thought you always said these so-called 'liberal' people
      were the worst of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats! Woman never can understand the different definitions of a word.
      Depends on how you mean it. And it don't pay to be too cocksure about
      anything. Now, these strikers: Honest, they're not such bad people. Just
      foolish. They don't understand the complications of merchandizing and
      profit, the way we business men do, but sometimes I think they're about
      like the rest of us, and no more hogs for wages than we are for profits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George! If people were to hear you talk like that&mdash;of course I KNOW
      you; I remember what a wild crazy boy you were; I know you don't mean a
      word you say&mdash;but if people that didn't understand you were to hear
      you talking, they'd think you were a regular socialist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care what anybody thinks? And let me tell you right now&mdash;I
      want you to distinctly understand I never was a wild crazy kid, and when I
      say a thing, I mean it, and I stand by it and&mdash;Honest, do you think
      people would think I was too liberal if I just said the strikers were
      decent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they would. But don't worry, dear; I know you don't mean a word
      of it. Time to trot up to bed now. Have you enough covers for to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the sleeping-porch he puzzled, &ldquo;She doesn't understand me. Hardly
      understand myself. Why can't I take things easy, way I used to?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I could go out to Senny Doane's house and talk things over with him.
      No! Suppose Verg Gunch saw me going in there!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I knew some really smart woman, and nice, that would see what I'm
      trying to get at, and let me talk to her and&mdash;I wonder if Myra's
      right? Could the fellows think I've gone nutty just because I'm
      broad-minded and liberal? Way Verg looked at me&mdash;&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      MISS McGOUN came into his private office at three in the afternoon with
      &ldquo;Lissen, Mr. Babbitt; there's a Mrs. Judique on the 'phone&mdash;wants to
      see about some repairs, and the salesmen are all out. Want to talk to
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Tanis Judique was clear and pleasant. The black cylinder of
      the telephone-receiver seemed to hold a tiny animated image of her:
      lustrous eyes, delicate nose, gentle chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mrs. Judique. Do you remember me? You drove me up here to the
      Cavendish Apartments and helped me find such a nice flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! Bet I remember! What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's just a little&mdash;I don't know that I ought to bother you,
      but the janitor doesn't seem to be able to fix it. You know my flat is on
      the top floor, and with these autumn rains the roof is beginning to leak,
      and I'd be awfully glad if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! I'll come up and take a look at it.&rdquo; Nervously, &ldquo;When do you expect
      to be in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm in every morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be in this afternoon, in an hour or so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es. Perhaps I could give you a cup of tea. I think I ought to, after
      all your trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine! I'll run up there soon as I can get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meditated, &ldquo;Now there's a woman that's got refinement, savvy, CLASS!
      'After all your trouble&mdash;give you a cup of tea.' She'd appreciate a
      fellow. I'm a fool, but I'm not such a bad cuss, get to know me. And not
      so much a fool as they think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great strike was over, the strikers beaten. Except that Vergil Gunch
      seemed less cordial, there were no visible effects of Babbitt's treachery
      to the clan. The oppressive fear of criticism was gone, but a diffident
      loneliness remained. Now he was so exhilarated that, to prove he wasn't,
      he droned about the office for fifteen minutes, looking at blue-prints,
      explaining to Miss McGoun that this Mrs. Scott wanted more money for her
      house&mdash;had raised the asking-price&mdash;raised it from seven
      thousand to eighty-five hundred&mdash;would Miss McGoun be sure and put it
      down on the card&mdash;Mrs. Scott's house&mdash;raise. When he had thus
      established himself as a person unemotional and interested only in
      business, he sauntered out. He took a particularly long time to start his
      car; he kicked the tires, dusted the glass of the speedometer, and
      tightened the screws holding the wind-shield spot-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove happily off toward the Bellevue district, conscious of the
      presence of Mrs. Judique as of a brilliant light on the horizon. The maple
      leaves had fallen and they lined the gutters of the asphalted streets. It
      was a day of pale gold and faded green, tranquil and lingering. Babbitt
      was aware of the meditative day, and of the barrenness of Bellevue&mdash;blocks
      of wooden houses, garages, little shops, weedy lots. &ldquo;Needs pepping up;
      needs the touch that people like Mrs. Judique could give a place,&rdquo; he
      ruminated, as he rattled through the long, crude, airy streets. The wind
      rose, enlivening, keen, and in a blaze of well-being he came to the flat
      of Tanis Judique.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing, when she flutteringly admitted him, a frock of black
      chiffon cut modestly round at the base of her pretty throat. She seemed to
      him immensely sophisticated. He glanced at the cretonnes and colored
      prints in her living-room, and gurgled, &ldquo;Gosh, you've fixed the place
      nice! Takes a clever woman to know how to make a home, all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really like it? I'm so glad! But you've neglected me, scandalously.
      You promised to come some time and learn to dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather unsteadily, &ldquo;Oh, but you didn't mean it seriously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. But you might have tried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I've come for my lesson, and you might just as well prepare to
      have me stay for supper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed in a manner which indicated that of course he didn't
      mean it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first I guess I better look at that leak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She climbed with him to the flat roof of the apartment-house a detached
      world of slatted wooden walks, clotheslines, water-tank in a penthouse. He
      poked at things with his toe, and sought to impress her by being learned
      about copper gutters, the desirability of passing plumbing pipes through a
      lead collar and sleeve and flashing them with copper, and the advantages
      of cedar over boiler-iron for roof-tanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to know so much, in real estate!&rdquo; she admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised that the roof should be repaired within two days. &ldquo;Do you mind
      my 'phoning from your apartment?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment at the coping, looking over a land of hard little
      bungalows with abnormally large porches, and new apartment-houses, small,
      but brave with variegated brick walls and terra-cotta trimmings. Beyond
      them was a hill with a gouge of yellow clay like a vast wound. Behind
      every apartment-house, beside each dwelling, were small garages. It was a
      world of good little people, comfortable, industrious, credulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumnal light the flat newness was mellowed, and the air was a
      sun-tinted pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golly, it's one fine afternoon. You get a great view here, right up
      Tanner's Hill,&rdquo; said Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn't it nice and open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So darn few people appreciate a View.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you go raising my rent on that account! Oh, that was naughty of me!
      I was just teasing. Seriously though, there are so few who respond&mdash;who
      react to Views. I mean&mdash;they haven't any feeling of poetry and
      beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact, they haven't,&rdquo; he breathed, admiring her slenderness and
      the absorbed, airy way in which she looked toward the hill, chin lifted,
      lips smiling. &ldquo;Well, guess I'd better telephone the plumbers, so they'll
      get on the job first thing in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had telephoned, making it conspicuously authoritative and gruff
      and masculine, he looked doubtful, and sighed, &ldquo;S'pose I'd better be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must have that cup of tea first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it would go pretty good, at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was luxurious to loll in a deep green rep chair, his legs thrust out
      before him, to glance at the black Chinese telephone stand and the colored
      photograph of Mount Vernon which he had always liked so much, while in the
      tiny kitchen&mdash;so near&mdash;Mrs. Judique sang &ldquo;My Creole Queen.&rdquo; In
      an intolerable sweetness, a contentment so deep that he was wistfully
      discontented, he saw magnolias by moonlight and heard plantation darkies
      crooning to the banjo. He wanted to be near her, on pretense of helping
      her, yet he wanted to remain in this still ecstasy. Languidly he remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she bustled in with the tea he smiled up at her. &ldquo;This is awfully
      nice!&rdquo; For the first time, he was not fencing; he was quietly and securely
      friendly; and friendly and quiet was her answer: &ldquo;It's nice to have you
      here. You were so kind, helping me to find this little home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They agreed that the weather would soon turn cold. They agreed that
      prohibition was prohibitive. They agreed that art in the home was
      cultural. They agreed about everything. They even became bold. They hinted
      that these modern young girls, well, honestly, their short skirts were
      short. They were proud to find that they were not shocked by such frank
      speaking. Tanis ventured, &ldquo;I know you'll understand&mdash;I mean&mdash;I
      don't quite know how to say it, but I do think that girls who pretend
      they're bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. They give
      away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,
      Babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had used
      him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the strike:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a
      standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their side.
      For a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal, don't
      you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do!&rdquo; Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands beside
      her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of being
      appreciated he proclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I up and said to the fellows at the club, 'Look here,' I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to the Union Club? I think it's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the Athletic. Tell you: Course they're always asking me to join the
      Union, but I always say, 'No, sir! Nothing doing!' I don't mind the
      expense but I can't stand all the old fogies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, that's so. But tell me: what did you say to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don't want to hear it. I'm probably boring you to death with my
      troubles! You wouldn't hardly think I was an old duffer; I sound like a
      kid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're a boy yet. I mean&mdash;you can't be a day over forty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not&mdash;much. But by golly I begin to feel middle-aged
      sometimes; all these responsibilities and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know!&rdquo; Her voice caressed him; it cloaked him like warm silk. &ldquo;And
      I feel lonely, so lonely, some days, Mr. Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're a sad pair of birds! But I think we're pretty darn nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think we're lots nicer than most people I know!&rdquo; They smiled. &ldquo;But
      please tell me what you said at the Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was like this: Course Seneca Doane is a friend of mine&mdash;they
      can say what they want to, they can call him anything they please, but
      what most folks here don't know is that Senny is the bosom pal of some of
      the biggest statesmen in the world&mdash;Lord Wycombe, frinstance&mdash;you
      know, this big British nobleman. My friend Sir Gerald Doak told me that
      Lord Wycombe is one of the biggest guns in England&mdash;well, Doak or
      somebody told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Do you know Sir Gerald? The one that was here, at the McKelveys'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him? Well, say, I know him just well enough so we call each other
      George and Jerry, and we got so pickled together in Chicago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must have been fun. But&mdash;&rdquo; She shook a finger at him. &ldquo;&mdash;I
      can't have you getting pickled! I'll have to take you in hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish you would! . . . Well, zize saying: You see I happen to know what a
      big noise Senny Doane is outside of Zenith, but of course a prophet hasn't
      got any honor in his own country, and Senny, darn his old hide, he's so
      blame modest that he never lets folks know the kind of an outfit he
      travels with when he goes abroad. Well, during the strike Clarence Drum
      comes pee-rading up to our table, all dolled up fit to kill in his nice
      lil cap'n's uniform, and somebody says to him, 'Busting the strike,
      Clarence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he swells up like a pouter-pigeon and he hollers, so 's you could
      hear him way up in the reading-room, 'Yes, sure; I told the strike-leaders
      where they got off, and so they went home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' I says to him, 'glad there wasn't any violence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' he says, 'but if I hadn't kept my eye skinned there would 've
      been. All those fellows had bombs in their pockets. They're reg'lar
      anarchists.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, rats, Clarence,' I says, 'I looked 'em all over carefully, and they
      didn't have any more bombs 'n a rabbit,' I says. 'Course,' I says,
      'they're foolish, but they're a good deal like you and me, after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then Vergil Gunch or somebody&mdash;no, it was Chum Frink&mdash;you
      know, this famous poet&mdash;great pal of mine&mdash;he says to me, 'Look
      here,' he says, 'do you mean to say you advocate these strikes?' Well, I
      was so disgusted with a fellow whose mind worked that way that I swear, I
      had a good mind to not explain at all&mdash;just ignore him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's so wise!&rdquo; said Mrs. Judique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;but finally I explains to him: 'If you'd done as much as I have on
      Chamber of Commerce committees and all,' I says, 'then you'd have the
      right to talk! But same time,' I says, 'I believe in treating your
      opponent like a gentleman!' Well, sir, that held 'em! Frink&mdash;Chum I
      always call him&mdash;he didn't have another word to say. But at that, I
      guess some of 'em kind o' thought I was too liberal. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were so wise. And courageous! I love a man to have the courage of
      his convictions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think it was a good stunt? After all, some of these fellows
      are so darn cautious and narrow-minded that they're prejudiced against a
      fellow that talks right out in meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you care? In the long run they're bound to respect a man who
      makes them think, and with your reputation for oratory you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about my reputation for oratory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not going to tell you everything I know! But seriously, you don't
      realize what a famous man you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Though I haven't done much orating this fall. Too kind of
      bothered by this Paul Riesling business, I guess. But&mdash;Do you know,
      you're the first person that's really understood what I was getting at,
      Tanis&mdash;Listen to me, will you! Fat nerve I've got, calling you
      Tanis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do! And shall I call you George? Don't you think it's awfully nice
      when two people have so much&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;so much
      analysis that they can discard all these stupid conventions and understand
      each other and become acquainted right away, like ships that pass in the
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do! I certainly do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was no longer quiescent in his chair; he wandered about the room, he
      dropped on the couch beside her. But as he awkwardly stretched his hand
      toward her fragile, immaculate fingers, she said brightly, &ldquo;Do give me a
      cigarette. Would you think poor Tanis was dreadfully naughty if she
      smoked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, no! I like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had often and weightily pondered flappers smoking in Zenith
      restaurants, but he knew only one woman who smoked&mdash;Mrs. Sam
      Doppelbrau, his flighty neighbor. He ceremoniously lighted Tanis's
      cigarette, looked for a place to deposit the burnt match, and dropped it
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you want a cigar, you poor man!&rdquo; she crooned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I love the smell of a good cigar; so nice and&mdash;so nice and
      like a man. You'll find an ash-tray in my bedroom, on the table beside the
      bed, if you don't mind getting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was embarrassed by her bedroom: the broad couch with a cover of violet
      silk, mauve curtains striped with gold. Chinese Chippendale bureau, and an
      amazing row of slippers, with ribbon-wound shoe-trees, and primrose
      stockings lying across them. His manner of bringing the ash-tray had just
      the right note of easy friendliness, he felt. &ldquo;A boob like Verg Gunch
      would try to get funny about seeing her bedroom, but I take it casually.&rdquo;
       He was not casual afterward. The contentment of companionship was gone,
      and he was restless with desire to touch her hand. But whenever he turned
      toward her, the cigarette was in his way. It was a shield between them. He
      waited till she should have finished, but as he rejoiced at her quick
      crushing of its light on the ashtray she said, &ldquo;Don't you want to give me
      another cigarette?&rdquo; and hopelessly he saw the screen of pale smoke and her
      graceful tilted hand again between them. He was not merely curious now to
      find out whether she would let him hold her hand (all in the purest
      friendship, naturally), but agonized with need of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the surface appeared none of all this fretful drama. They were talking
      cheerfully of motors, of trips to California, of Chum Frink. Once he said
      delicately, &ldquo;I do hate these guys&mdash;I hate these people that invite
      themselves to meals, but I seem to have a feeling I'm going to have supper
      with the lovely Mrs. Tanis Judique to-night. But I suppose you probably
      have seven dates already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was thinking some of going to the movies. Yes, I really think I
      ought to get out and get some fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not encourage him to stay, but never did she discourage him. He
      considered, &ldquo;I better take a sneak! She WILL let me stay&mdash;there IS
      something doing&mdash;and I mustn't get mixed up with&mdash;I mustn't&mdash;I've
      got to beat it.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;No. it's too late now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, at seven, brushing her cigarette away, brusquely taking her
      hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tanis! Stop teasing me! You know we&mdash;Here we are, a couple of lonely
      birds, and we're awful happy together. Anyway I am! Never been so happy!
      Do let me stay! I'll gallop down to the delicatessen and buy some stuff&mdash;cold
      chicken maybe&mdash;or cold turkey&mdash;and we can have a nice little
      supper, and afterwards, if you want to chase me out, I'll be good and go
      like a lamb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;it would be nice,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did she withdraw her hand. He squeezed it, trembling, and blundered
      toward his coat. At the delicatessen he bought preposterous stores of
      food, chosen on the principle of expensiveness. From the drug store across
      the street he telephoned to his wife, &ldquo;Got to get a fellow to sign a lease
      before he leaves town on the midnight. Won't be home till late. Don't wait
      up for me. Kiss Tinka good-night.&rdquo; He expectantly lumbered back to the
      flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you bad thing, to buy so much food!&rdquo; was her greeting, and her voice
      was gay, her smile acceptant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her in the tiny white kitchen; he washed the lettuce, he opened
      the olive bottle. She ordered him to set the table, and as he trotted into
      the living-room, as he hunted through the buffet for knives and forks, he
      felt utterly at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the only other thing,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;is what you're going to wear. I
      can't decide whether you're to put on your swellest evening gown, or let
      your hair down and put on short skirts and make-believe you're a little
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to dine just as I am, in this old chiffon rag, and if you can't
      stand poor Tanis that way, you can go to the club for dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand you!&rdquo; He patted her shoulder. &ldquo;Child, you're the brainiest and the
      loveliest and finest woman I've ever met! Come now, Lady Wycombe, if
      you'll take the Duke of Zenith's arm, we will proambulate in to the
      magnolious feed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do say the funniest, nicest things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished the picnic supper he thrust his head out of the
      window and reported, &ldquo;It's turned awful chilly, and I think it's going to
      rain. You don't want to go to the movies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we had a fireplace! I wish it was raining like all get-out
      to-night, and we were in a funny little old-fashioned cottage, and the
      trees thrashing like everything outside, and a great big log fire and&mdash;I'll
      tell you! Let's draw this couch up to the radiator, and stretch our feet
      out, and pretend it's a wood-fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think that's pathetic! You big child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they did draw up to the radiator, and propped their feet against it&mdash;his
      clumsy black shoes, her patent-leather slippers. In the dimness they
      talked of themselves; of how lonely she was, how bewildered he, and how
      wonderful that they had found each other. As they fell silent the room was
      stiller than a country lane. There was no sound from the street save the
      whir of motor-tires, the rumble of a distant freight-train. Self-contained
      was the room, warm, secure, insulated from the harassing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was absorbed by a rapture in which all fear and doubting were smoothed
      away; and when he reached home, at dawn, the rapture had mellowed to
      contentment serene and full of memories.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE assurance of Tanis Judique's friendship fortified Babbitt's
      self-approval. At the Athletic Club he became experimental. Though Vergil
      Gunch was silent, the others at the Roughnecks' Table came to accept
      Babbitt as having, for no visible reason, &ldquo;turned crank.&rdquo; They argued
      windily with him, and he was cocky, and enjoyed the spectacle of his
      interesting martyrdom. He even praised Seneca Doane. Professor Pumphrey
      said that was carrying a joke too far; but Babbitt argued, &ldquo;No! Fact! I
      tell you he's got one of the keenest intellects in the country. Why, Lord
      Wycombe said that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, who the hell is Lord Wycombe? What you always lugging him in for? You
      been touting him for the last six weeks!&rdquo; protested Orville Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George ordered him from Sears-Roebuck. You can get those English
      high-muckamucks by mail for two bucks apiece,&rdquo; suggested Sidney
      Finkelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right now! Lord Wycombe, he's one of the biggest intellects in
      English political life. As I was saying: Of course I'm conservative
      myself, but I appreciate a guy like Senny Doane because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vergil Gunch interrupted harshly, &ldquo;I wonder if you are so conservative? I
      find I can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds like
      Doane in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grimness of Gunch's voice, the hardness of his jaw, disconcerted
      Babbitt, but he recovered and went on till they looked bored, then
      irritated, then as doubtful as Gunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of Tanis always. With a stir he remembered her every aspect.
      His arms yearned for her. &ldquo;I've found her! I've dreamed of her all these
      years and now I've found her!&rdquo; he exulted. He met her at the movies in the
      morning; he drove out to her flat in the late afternoon or on evenings
      when he was believed to be at the Elks. He knew her financial affairs and
      advised her about them, while she lamented her feminine ignorance, and
      praised his masterfulness, and proved to know much more about bonds than
      he did. They had remembrances, and laughter over old times. Once they
      quarreled, and he raged that she was as &ldquo;bossy&rdquo; as his wife and far more
      whining when he was inattentive. But that passed safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their high hour was a tramp on a ringing December afternoon, through
      snow-drifted meadows down to the icy Chaloosa River. She was exotic in an
      astrachan cap and a short beaver coat; she slid on the ice and shouted,
      and he panted after her, rotund with laughter.... Myra Babbitt never slid
      on the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid that they would be seen together. In Zenith it is impossible
      to lunch with a neighbor's wife without the fact being known, before
      nightfall, in every house in your circle. But Tanis was beautifully
      discreet. However appealingly she might turn to him when they were alone,
      she was gravely detached when they were abroad, and he hoped that she
      would be taken for a client. Orville Jones once saw them emerging from a
      movie theater, and Babbitt bumbled, &ldquo;Let me make you 'quainted with Mrs.
      Judique. Now here's a lady who knows the right broker to come to, Orvy!&rdquo;
       Mr. Jones, though he was a man censorious of morals and of laundry
      machinery, seemed satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      His predominant fear&mdash;not from any especial fondness for her but from
      the habit of propriety&mdash;was that his wife would learn of the affair.
      He was certain that she knew nothing specific about Tanis, but he was also
      certain that she suspected something indefinite. For years she had been
      bored by anything more affectionate than a farewell kiss, yet she was hurt
      by any slackening in his irritable periodic interest, and now he had no
      interest; rather, a revulsion. He was completely faithful&mdash;to Tanis.
      He was distressed by the sight of his wife's slack plumpness, by her puffs
      and billows of flesh, by the tattered petticoat which she was always
      meaning and always forgetting to throw away. But he was aware that she, so
      long attuned to him, caught all his repulsions. He elaborately, heavily,
      jocularly tried to check them. He couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a tolerable Christmas. Kenneth Escott was there, admittedly
      engaged to Verona. Mrs. Babbitt was tearful and called Kenneth her new
      son. Babbitt was worried about Ted, because he had ceased complaining of
      the State University and become suspiciously acquiescent. He wondered what
      the boy was planning, and was too shy to ask. Himself, Babbitt slipped
      away on Christmas afternoon to take his present, a silver cigarette-box,
      to Tanis. When he returned Mrs. Babbitt asked, much too innocently, &ldquo;Did
      you go out for a little fresh air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just lil drive,&rdquo; he mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      After New Year's his wife proposed, &ldquo;I heard from my sister to-day,
      George. She isn't well. I think perhaps I ought to go stay with her for a
      few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mrs. Babbitt was not accustomed to leave home during the winter
      except on violently demanding occasions, and only the summer before, she
      had been gone for weeks. Nor was Babbitt one of the detachable husbands
      who take separations casually. He liked to have her there; she looked after
      his clothes; she knew how his steak ought to be cooked; and her clucking
      made him feel secure. But he could not drum up even a dutiful &ldquo;Oh, she
      doesn't really need you, does she?&rdquo; While he tried to look regretful,
      while he felt that his wife was watching him, he was filled with exultant
      visions of Tanis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I'd better go?&rdquo; she said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to decide, honey; I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, sighing, and his forehead was damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till she went, four days later, she was curiously still, he cumbrously
      affectionate. Her train left at noon. As he saw it grow small beyond the
      train-shed he longed to hurry to Tanis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by golly, I won't do that!&rdquo; he vowed. &ldquo;I won't go near her for a
      week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was at her flat at four.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      He who had once controlled or seemed to control his life in a progress
      unimpassioned but diligent and sane was for that fortnight borne on a
      current of desire and very bad whisky and all the complications of new
      acquaintances, those furious new intimates who demand so much more
      attention than old friends. Each morning he gloomily recognized his
      idiocies of the evening before. With his head throbbing, his tongue and
      lips stinging from cigarettes, he incredulously counted the number of
      drinks he had taken, and groaned, &ldquo;I got to quit!&rdquo; He had ceased saying,
      &ldquo;I WILL quit!&rdquo; for however resolute he might be at dawn, he could not, for
      a single evening, check his drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had met Tanis's friends; he had, with the ardent haste of the Midnight
      People, who drink and dance and rattle and are ever afraid to be silent,
      been adopted as a member of her group, which they called &ldquo;The Bunch.&rdquo; He
      first met them after a day when he had worked particularly hard and when
      he hoped to be quiet with Tanis and slowly sip her admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      From down the hall he could hear shrieks and the grind of a phonograph. As
      Tanis opened the door he saw fantastic figures dancing in a haze of
      cigarette smoke. The tables and chairs were against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, isn't this dandy!&rdquo; she gabbled at him. &ldquo;Carrie Nork had the loveliest
      idea. She decided it was time for a party, and she 'phoned the Bunch and
      told 'em to gather round. . . . George, this is Carrie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carrie&rdquo; was, in the less desirable aspects of both, at once matronly and
      spinsterish. She was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing
      ash-blond; and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous. She greeted
      Babbitt with a giggling &ldquo;Welcome to our little midst! Tanis says you're a
      real sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was apparently expected to dance, to be boyish and gay with Carrie, and
      he did his unforgiving best. He towed her about the room, bumping into
      other couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly ambushed. As
      he danced he surveyed the rest of the Bunch: A thin young woman who looked
      capable, conceited, and sarcastic. Another woman whom he could never quite
      remember. Three overdressed and slightly effeminate young men&mdash;soda-fountain
      clerks, or at least born for that profession. A man of his own age,
      immovable, self-satisfied, resentful of Babbitt's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged,
      &ldquo;Dear, wouldn't you like to do something for me? I'm all out of booze, and
      the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn't you just skip down to Healey
      Hanson's and get some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said, trying not to sound sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you: I'll get Minnie Sonntag to drive down with you.&rdquo; Tanis was
      pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sonntag greeted him with an astringent &ldquo;How d'you do, Mr. Babbitt.
      Tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and I'm honored by being
      allowed to drive with you. Of course I'm not accustomed to associating
      with society people like you, so I don't know how to act in such exalted
      circles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Miss Sonntag talked all the way down to Healey Hanson's. To her jibes
      he wanted to reply &ldquo;Oh, go to the devil!&rdquo; but he never quite nerved
      himself to that reasonable comment. He was resenting the existence of the
      whole Bunch. He had heard Tanis speak of &ldquo;darling Carrie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Min Sonntag&mdash;she's
      so clever&mdash;you'll adore her,&rdquo; but they had never been real to him. He
      had pictured Tanis as living in a rose-tinted vacuum, waiting for him,
      free of all the complications of a Floral Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned he had to endure the patronage of the young
      soda-clerks. They were as damply friendly as Miss Sonntag was dryly
      hostile. They called him &ldquo;Old Georgie&rdquo; and shouted, &ldquo;Come on now, sport;
      shake a leg&rdquo; . . . boys in belted coats, pimply boys, as young as Ted and
      as flabby as chorus-men, but powerful to dance and to mind the phonograph
      and smoke cigarettes and patronize Tanis. He tried to be one of them; he
      cried &ldquo;Good work, Pete!&rdquo; but his voice creaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tanis apparently enjoyed the companionship of the dancing darlings; she
      bridled to their bland flirtation and casually kissed them at the end of
      each dance. Babbitt hated her, for the moment. He saw her as middle-aged.
      He studied the wrinkles in the softness of her throat, the slack flesh
      beneath her chin. The taut muscles of her youth were loose and drooping.
      Between dances she sat in the largest chair, waving her cigarette,
      summoning her callow admirers to come and talk to her. (&ldquo;She thinks she's
      a blooming queen!&rdquo; growled Babbitt.) She chanted to Miss Sonntag, &ldquo;Isn't
      my little studio sweet?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Studio, rats! It's a plain
      old-maid-and-chow-dog flat! Oh, God, I wish I was home! I wonder if I
      can't make a getaway now?&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      His vision grew blurred, however, as he applied himself to Healey Hanson's
      raw but vigorous whisky. He blended with the Bunch. He began to rejoice
      that Carrie Nork and Pete, the most nearly intelligent of the nimble
      youths, seemed to like him; and it was enormously important to win over
      the surly older man, who proved to be a railway clerk named Fulton Bemis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation of the Bunch was exclamatory, high-colored, full of
      references to people whom Babbitt did not know. Apparently they thought
      very comfortably of themselves. They were the Bunch, wise and beautiful
      and amusing; they were Bohemians and urbanites, accustomed to all the
      luxuries of Zenith: dance-halls, movie-theaters, and roadhouses; and in a
      cynical superiority to people who were &ldquo;slow&rdquo; or &ldquo;tightwad&rdquo; they cackled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pete, did I tell you what that dub of a cashier said when I came in
      late yesterday? Oh, it was per-fect-ly priceless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but wasn't T. D. stewed! Say, he was simply ossified! What did Gladys
      say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the nerve of Bob Bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his
      house! Say, the nerve of him! Can you beat it for nerve? Some nerve I call
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice how Dotty was dancing? Gee, wasn't she the limit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated Miss
      Minnie Sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to jazz
      music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; when
      Mrs. Carrie Nork gurgled, &ldquo;Don't you love to sit on the floor? It's so
      Bohemian!&rdquo; He began to think extremely well of the Bunch. When he
      mentioned his friends Sir Gerald Doak, Lord Wycombe, William Washington
      Eathorne, and Chum Frink, he was proud of their condescending interest. He
      got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didn't much mind seeing
      Tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest of the
      young men, and he himself desired to hold Carrie Nork's pulpy hand, and
      dropped it only because Tanis looked angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went home, at two, he was fully a member of the Bunch, and all the
      week thereafter he was bound by the exceedingly straitened conventions,
      the exceedingly wearing demands, of their life of pleasure and freedom. He
      had to go to their parties; he was involved in the agitation when
      everybody telephoned to everybody else that she hadn't meant what she'd
      said when she'd said that, and anyway, why was Pete going around saying
      she'd said it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was a Family more insistent on learning one another's movements than
      were the Bunch. All of them volubly knew, or indignantly desired to know,
      where all the others had been every minute of the week. Babbitt found
      himself explaining to Carrie or Fulton Bemis just what he had been doing
      that he should not have joined them till ten o'clock, and apologizing for
      having gone to dinner with a business acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every member of the Bunch was expected to telephone to every other member
      at least once a week. &ldquo;Why haven't you called me up?&rdquo; Babbitt was asked
      accusingly, not only by Tanis and Carrie but presently by new ancient
      friends, Jennie and Capitolina and Toots.
    </p>
    <p>
      If for a moment he had seen Tanis as withering and sentimental, he lost
      that impression at Carrie Nork's dance. Mrs. Nork had a large house and a
      small husband. To her party came all of the Bunch, perhaps thirty-five of
      them when they were completely mobilized. Babbitt, under the name of &ldquo;Old
      Georgie,&rdquo; was now a pioneer of the Bunch, since each month it changed half
      its membership and he who could recall the prehistoric days of a fortnight
      ago, before Mrs. Absolom, the food-demonstrator, had gone to Indianapolis,
      and Mac had &ldquo;got sore at&rdquo; Minnie, was a venerable leader and able to
      condescend to new Petes and Minnies and Gladyses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Carrie's, Tanis did not have to work at being hostess. She was
      dignified and sure, a clear fine figure in the black chiffon frock he had
      always loved; and in the wider spaces of that ugly house Babbitt was able
      to sit quietly with her. He repented of his first revulsion, mooned at her
      feet, and happily drove her home. Next day he bought a violent yellow tie,
      to make himself young for her. He knew, a little sadly, that he could not
      make himself beautiful; he beheld himself as heavy, hinting of fatness,
      but he danced, he dressed, he chattered, to be as young as she was . . .
      as young as she seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      As all converts, whether to a religion, love, or gardening, find as by
      magic that though hitherto these hobbies have not seemed to exist, now the
      whole world is filled with their fury, so, once he was converted to
      dissipation, Babbitt discovered agreeable opportunities for it everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a new view of his sporting neighbor, Sam Doppelbrau. The
      Doppelbraus were respectable people, industrious people, prosperous
      people, whose ideal of happiness was an eternal cabaret. Their life was
      dominated by suburban bacchanalia of alcohol, nicotine, gasoline, and
      kisses. They and their set worked capably all the week, and all week
      looked forward to Saturday night, when they would, as they expressed it,
      &ldquo;throw a party;&rdquo; and the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to
      Sunday dawn, and usually included an extremely rapid motor expedition to
      nowhere in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when Tanis was at the theater, Babbitt found himself being
      lively with the Doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he had for
      years privily denounced to Mrs. Babbitt as a &ldquo;rotten bunch of tin-horns
      that I wouldn't go out with, not if they were the last people on earth.&rdquo;
       That evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in front of the
      house, chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil footprints, made
      by the steps of passers-by during the recent snow. Howard Littlefield came
      up snuffling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still a widower, George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yump. Cold again to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you hear from the wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's feeling fine, but her sister is still pretty sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, better come in and have dinner with us to-night, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, thanks. Have to go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he could not endure Littlefield's recitals of the more
      interesting statistics about totally uninteresting problems. He scraped at
      the walk and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Doppelbrau appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evenin', Babbitt. Working hard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh, lil exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold enough for you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still a widower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Babbitt, while she's away&mdash;I know you don't care much for
      booze-fights, but the Missus and I'd be awfully glad if you could come in
      some night. Think you could stand a good cocktail for once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand it? Young fella, I bet old Uncle George can mix the best cocktail
      in these United States!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurray! That's the way to talk! Look here: There's some folks coming to
      the house to-night, Louetta Swanson and some other live ones, and I'm
      going to open up a bottle of pre-war gin, and maybe we'll dance a while.
      Why don't you drop in and jazz it up a little, just for a change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;What time they coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at Sam Doppelbrau's at nine. It was the third time he had entered
      the house. By ten he was calling Mr. Doppelbrau &ldquo;Sam, old hoss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At eleven they all drove out to the Old Farm Inn. Babbitt sat in the back
      of Doppelbrau's car with Louetta Swanson. Once he had timorously tried to
      make love to her. Now he did not try; he merely made love; and Louetta
      dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger Eddie was, and
      accepted Babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of Tanis's Bunch, the Doppelbraus, and other
      companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when
      he did not return home late and shaky. With his other faculties blurred he
      yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could scarce
      walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching cars. He
      came wambling into the house. If Verona and Kenneth Escott were about, he
      got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their level young
      glances, and hid himself up-stairs. He found when he came into the warm
      house that he was hazier than he had believed. His head whirled. He dared
      not lie down. He tried to soak out the alcohol in a hot bath. For the
      moment his head was clearer but when he moved about the bathroom his
      calculations of distance were wrong, so that he dragged down the towels,
      and knocked over the soap-dish with a clatter which, he feared, would
      betray him to the children. Chilly in his dressing-gown he tried to read
      the evening paper. He could follow every word; he seemed to take in the
      sense of things; but a minute afterward he could not have told what he had
      been reading. When he went to bed his brain flew in circles, and he
      hastily sat up, struggling for self-control. At last he was able to lie
      still, feeling only a little sick and dizzy&mdash;and enormously ashamed.
      To hide his &ldquo;condition&rdquo; from his own children! To have danced and shouted
      with people whom he despised! To have said foolish things, sung idiotic
      songs, tried to kiss silly girls! Incredulously he remembered that he had
      by his roaring familiarity with them laid himself open to the patronizing
      of youths whom he would have kicked out of his office; that by dancing too
      ardently he had exposed himself to rebukes from the rattiest of withering
      women. As it came relentlessly back to him he snarled, &ldquo;I hate myself! God
      how I hate myself!&rdquo; But, he raged, &ldquo;I'm through! No more! Had enough,
      plenty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was even surer about it the morning after, when he was trying to be
      grave and paternal with his daughters at breakfast. At noontime he was
      less sure. He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as
      clearly as at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than going
      back to a life of barren heartiness. At four he wanted a drink. He kept a
      whisky flask in his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he had his
      drink. Three drinks later he began to see the Bunch as tender and amusing
      friends, and by six he was with them . . . and the tale was to be told all
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each morning his head ached a little less. A bad head for drinks had been
      his safeguard, but the safeguard was crumbling. Presently he could be
      drunk at dawn, yet not feel particularly wretched in his conscience&mdash;or
      in his stomach&mdash;when he awoke at eight. No regret, no desire to
      escape the toil of keeping up with the arduous merriment of the Bunch, was
      so great as his feeling of social inferiority when he failed to keep up.
      To be the &ldquo;livest&rdquo; of them was as much his ambition now as it had been to
      excel at making money, at playing golf, at motor-driving, at oratory, at
      climbing to the McKelvey set. But occasionally he failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that Pete and the other young men considered the Bunch too
      austerely polite and the Carrie who merely kissed behind doors too
      embarrassingly monogamic. As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to
      the Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the Bunch
      off to &ldquo;times&rdquo; with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department
      stores and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to accompany them. There
      was a motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a grubby shrieking
      cash-girl from Parcher and Stein's. He sat beside her and worried. He was
      apparently expected to &ldquo;jolly her along,&rdquo; but when she sang out, &ldquo;Hey,
      leggo, quit crushing me cootie-garage,&rdquo; he did not quite know how to go
      on. They sat in the back room of a saloon, and Babbitt had a headache, was
      confused by their new slang, looked at them benevolently, wanted to go
      home, and had a drink&mdash;a good many drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two evenings after, Fulton Bemis, the surly older man of the Bunch, took
      Babbitt aside and grunted, &ldquo;Look here, it's none of my business, and God
      knows I always lap up my share of the hootch, but don't you think you
      better watch yourself? You're one of these enthusiastic chumps that always
      overdo things. D' you realize you're throwing in the booze as fast as you
      can, and you eat one cigarette right after another? Better cut it out for
      a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt tearfully said that good old Fult was a prince, and yes, he
      certainly would cut it out, and thereafter he lighted a cigarette and took
      a drink and had a terrific quarrel with Tanis when she caught him being
      affectionate with Carrie Nork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he hated himself that he should have sunk into a position
      where a fifteenth-rater like Fulton Bemis could rebuke him. He perceived
      that, since he was making love to every woman possible, Tanis was no
      longer his one pure star, and he wondered whether she had ever been
      anything more to him than A Woman. And if Bemis had spoken to him, were
      other people talking about him? He suspiciously watched the men at the
      Athletic Club that noon. It seemed to him that they were uneasy. They had
      been talking about him then? He was angry. He became belligerent. He not
      only defended Seneca Doane but even made fun of the Y. M. C. A. Vergil
      Gunch was rather brief in his answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward Babbitt was not angry. He was afraid. He did not go to the next
      lunch of the Boosters' Club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and, while he
      munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on the arm of
      his chair, he worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later, when the Bunch were having one of their best parties,
      Babbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the
      Chaloosa River. After a thaw the streets had frozen in smooth ice. Down
      those wide endless streets the wind rattled between the rows of wooden
      houses, and the whole Bellevue district seemed a frontier town. Even with
      skid chains on all four wheels, Babbitt was afraid of sliding, and when he
      came to the long slide of a hill he crawled down, both brakes on. Slewing
      round a corner came a less cautious car. It skidded, it almost raked them
      with its rear fenders. In relief at their escape the Bunch&mdash;Tanis,
      Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton Bemis&mdash;shouted &ldquo;Oh, baby,&rdquo; and waved
      their hands to the agitated other driver. Then Babbitt saw Professor
      Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill, afoot, Staring owlishly at the
      revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized him and saw Tanis kiss him
      as she crowed, &ldquo;You're such a good driver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with &ldquo;Out last night with my brother
      and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery 's glass. Thought I
      saw you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wasn't&mdash;I didn't see you,&rdquo; said Pumphrey, hastily, rather
      guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel
      Thornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat
      had begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of
      her if he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to be
      seen with her except at the movies. He thought of taking her to the
      &ldquo;ladies' annex&rdquo; of the Athletic Club, but that was too dangerous. He would
      have to introduce her and, oh, people might misunderstand and&mdash;He
      compromised on the Thornleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was unusually smart, all in black: small black tricorne hat, short
      black caracul coat, loose and swinging, and austere high-necked black
      velvet frock at a time when most street costumes were like evening gowns.
      Perhaps she was too smart. Every one in the gold and oak restaurant of the
      Thornleigh was staring at her as Babbitt followed her to a table. He
      uneasily hoped that the head-waiter would give them a discreet place
      behind a pillar, but they were stationed on the center aisle. Tanis seemed
      not to notice her admirers; she smiled at Babbitt with a lavish &ldquo;Oh, isn't
      this nice! What a peppy-looking orchestra!&rdquo; Babbitt had difficulty in
      being lavish in return, for two tables away he saw Vergil Gunch. All
      through the meal Gunch watched them, while Babbitt watched himself being
      watched and lugubriously tried to keep from spoiling Tanis's gaiety. &ldquo;I
      felt like a spree to-day,&rdquo; she rippled. &ldquo;I love the Thornleigh, don't you?
      It's so live and yet so&mdash;so refined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made talk about the Thornleigh, the service, the food, the people he
      recognized in the restaurant, all but Vergil Gunch. There did not seem to
      be anything else to talk of. He smiled conscientiously at her fluttering
      jests; he agreed with her that Minnie Sonntag was &ldquo;so hard to get along
      with,&rdquo; and young Pete &ldquo;such a silly lazy kid, really just no good at all.&rdquo;
       But he himself had nothing to say. He considered telling her his worries
      about Gunch, but&mdash;&ldquo;oh, gosh, it was too much work to go into the
      whole thing and explain about Verg and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was relieved when he put Tanis on a trolley; he was cheerful in the
      familiar simplicities of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o'clock Vergil Gunch called on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was agitated, but Gunch began in a friendly way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the boy? Say, some of us are getting up a scheme we'd kind of like
      to have you come in on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, Verg. Shoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know during the war we had the Undesirable Element, the Reds and
      walking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights, and
      so did we for quite a while after the war, but folks forget about the
      danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working underground
      again, especially a lot of these parlor socialists. Well, it's up to the
      folks that do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep
      bucking these fellows. Some guy back East has organized a society called
      the Good Citizens' League for just that purpose. Of course the Chamber of
      Commerce and the American Legion and so on do a fine work in keeping the
      decent people in the saddle, but they're devoted to so many other causes
      that they can't attend to this one problem properly. But the Good
      Citizens' League, the G. C. L., they stick right to it. Oh, the G. C. L.
      has to have some other ostensible purposes&mdash;frinstance here in Zenith
      I think it ought to support the park-extension project and the City
      Planning Committee&mdash;and then, too, it should have a social aspect,
      being made up of the best people&mdash;have dances and so on, especially
      as one of the best ways it can put the kibosh on cranks is to apply this
      social boycott business to folks big enough so you can't reach 'em
      otherwise. Then if that don't work, the G. C. L. can finally send a little
      delegation around to inform folks that get too flip that they got to
      conform to decent standards and quit shooting off their mouths so free.
      Don't it sound like the organization could do a great work? We've already
      got some of the strongest men in town, and of course we want you in. How
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was uncomfortable. He felt a compulsion back to all the standards
      he had so vaguely yet so desperately been fleeing. He fumbled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'd especially light on fellows like Seneca Doane and try to
      make 'em&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your sweet life we would! Look here, old Georgie: I've never for
      one moment believed you meant it when you've defended Doane, and the
      strikers and so on, at the Club. I knew you were simply kidding those poor
      galoots like Sid Finkelstein.... At least I certainly hope you were
      kidding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;sure&mdash;Course you might say&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt was
      conscious of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and
      relentless eye. &ldquo;Gosh, you know where I stand! I'm no labor agitator! I'm
      a business man, first, last, and all the time! But&mdash;but honestly, I
      don't think Doane means so badly, and you got to remember he's an old
      friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, when it comes right down to a struggle between decency and the
      security of our homes on the one hand, and red ruin and those lazy dogs
      plotting for free beer on the other, you got to give up even old
      friendships. 'He that is not with me is against me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about it? Going to join us in the Good Citizens' League?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to think it over, Verg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, just as you say.&rdquo; Babbitt was relieved to be let off so
      easily, but Gunch went on: &ldquo;George, I don't know what's come over you;
      none of us do; and we've talked a lot about you. For a while we figured
      out you'd been upset by what happened to poor Riesling, and we forgave you
      for any fool thing you said, but that's old stuff now, George, and we
      can't make out what's got into you. Personally, I've always defended you,
      but I must say it's getting too much for me. All the boys at the Athletic
      Club and the Boosters' are sore, the way you go on deliberately touting
      Doane and his bunch of hell-hounds, and talking about being liberal&mdash;which
      means being wishy-washy&mdash;and even saying this preacher guy Ingram
      isn't a professional free-love artist. And then the way you been carrying
      on personally! Joe Pumphrey says he saw you out the other night with a
      gang of totties, all stewed to the gills, and here to-day coming right
      into the Thornleigh with a&mdash;well, she may be all right and a perfect
      lady, but she certainly did look like a pretty gay skirt for a fellow with
      his wife out of town to be taking to lunch. Didn't look well. What the
      devil has come over you, George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strikes me there's a lot of fellows that know more about my personal
      business than I do myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't go getting sore at me because I come out flatfooted like a
      friend and say what I think instead of tattling behind your back, the way
      a whole lot of 'em do. I tell you George, you got a position in the
      community, and the community expects you to live up to it. And&mdash;Better
      think over joining the Good Citizens' League. See you about it later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Babbitt dined alone. He saw all the Clan of Good Fellows
      peering through the restaurant window, spying on him. Fear sat beside him,
      and he told himself that to-night he would not go to Tanis's flat; and he
      did not go . . . till late.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE summer before, Mrs. Babbitt's letters had crackled with desire to
      return to Zenith. Now they said nothing of returning, but a wistful &ldquo;I
      suppose everything is going on all right without me&rdquo; among her dry
      chronicles of weather and sicknesses hinted to Babbitt that he hadn't been
      very urgent about her coming. He worried it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were here, and I went on raising cain like I been doing, she'd
      have a fit. I got to get hold of myself. I got to learn to play around and
      yet not make a fool of myself. I can do it, too, if folks like Verg Gunch
      'll let me alone, and Myra 'll stay away. But&mdash;poor kid, she sounds
      lonely. Lord, I don't want to hurt her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively he wrote that they missed her, and her next letter said
      happily that she was coming home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He persuaded himself that he was eager to see her. He bought roses for the
      house, he ordered squab for dinner, he had the car cleaned and polished.
      All the way home from the station with her he was adequate in his accounts
      of Ted's success in basket-ball at the university, but before they reached
      Floral Heights there was nothing more to say, and already he felt the
      force of her stolidity, wondered whether he could remain a good husband
      and still sneak out of the house this evening for half an hour with the
      Bunch. When he had housed the car he blundered upstairs, into the familiar
      talcum-scented warmth of her presence, blaring, &ldquo;Help you unpack your
      bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she turned, holding up a small box, and slowly she said, &ldquo;I brought
      you a present, just a new cigar-case. I don't know if you'd care to have
      it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was the lonely girl, the brown appealing Myra Thompson, whom he had
      married, and he almost wept for pity as he kissed her and besought, &ldquo;Oh,
      honey, honey, CARE to have it? Of course I do! I'm awful proud you brought
      it to me. And I needed a new case badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wondered how he would get rid of the case he had bought the week
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really are glad to see me back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you poor kiddy, what you been worrying about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you didn't seem to miss me very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had finished his stint of lying they were firmly bound
      again. By ten that evening it seemed improbable that she had ever been
      away. There was but one difference: the problem of remaining a respectable
      husband, a Floral Heights husband, yet seeing Tanis and the Bunch with
      frequency. He had promised to telephone to Tanis that evening, and now it
      was melodramatically impossible. He prowled about the telephone,
      impulsively thrusting out a hand to lift the receiver, but never quite
      daring to risk it. Nor could he find a reason for slipping down to the
      drug store on Smith Street, with its telephone-booth. He was laden with
      responsibility till he threw it off with the speculation: &ldquo;Why the deuce
      should I fret so about not being able to 'phone Tanis? She can get along
      without me. I don't owe her anything. She's a fine girl, but I've given
      her just as much as she has me. . . . Oh, damn these women and the way
      they get you all tied up in complications!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week he was attentive to his wife, took her to the theater, to
      dinner at the Littlefields'; then the old weary dodging and shifting began
      and at least two evenings a week he spent with the Bunch. He still made
      pretense of going to the Elks and to committee-meetings but less and less
      did he trouble to have his excuses interesting, less and less did she
      affect to believe them. He was certain that she knew he was associating
      with what Floral Heights called &ldquo;a sporty crowd,&rdquo; yet neither of them
      acknowledged it. In matrimonial geography the distance between the first
      mute recognition of a break and the admission thereof is as great as the
      distance between the first naive faith and the first doubting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he began to drift away he also began to see her as a human being, to
      like and dislike her instead of accepting her as a comparatively movable
      part of the furniture, and he compassionated that husband-and-wife
      relation which, in twenty-five years of married life, had become a
      separate and real entity. He recalled their high lights: the summer
      vacation in Virginia meadows under the blue wall of the mountains; their
      motor tour through Ohio, and the exploration of Cleveland, Cincinnati, and
      Columbus; the birth of Verona; their building of this new house, planned
      to comfort them through a happy old age&mdash;chokingly they had said that
      it might be the last home either of them would ever have. Yet his most
      softening remembrance of these dear moments did not keep him from barking
      at dinner, &ldquo;Yep, going out f' few hours. Don't sit up for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare now to come home drunk, and though he rejoiced in his
      return to high morality and spoke with gravity to Pete and Fulton Bemis
      about their drinking, he prickled at Myra's unexpressed criticisms and
      sulkily meditated that a &ldquo;fellow couldn't ever learn to handle himself if
      he was always bossed by a lot of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He no longer wondered if Tanis wasn't a bit worn and sentimental. In
      contrast to the complacent Myra he saw her as swift and air-borne and
      radiant, a fire-spirit tenderly stooping to the hearth, and however
      pitifully he brooded on his wife, he longed to be with Tanis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Babbitt tore the decent cloak from her unhappiness and the
      astounded male discovered that she was having a small determined rebellion
      of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      They were beside the fireless fire-place, in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you haven't given me the list of your household
      expenses while I was away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;Haven't made it out yet.&rdquo; Very affably: &ldquo;Gosh, we must try to
      keep down expenses this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. I don't know where all the money goes to. I try to economize,
      but it just seems to evaporate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I oughtn't to spend so much on cigars. Don't know but what I'll
      cut down my smoking, maybe cut it out entirely. I was thinking of a good
      way to do it, the other day: start on these cubeb cigarettes, and they'd
      kind of disgust me with smoking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do wish you would! It isn't that I care, but honestly, George, it
      is so bad for you to smoke so much. Don't you think you could reduce the
      amount? And George&mdash;I notice now, when you come home from these
      lodges and all, that sometimes you smell of whisky. Dearie, you know I
      don't worry so much about the moral side of it, but you have a weak
      stomach and you can't stand all this drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weak stomach, hell! I guess I can carry my booze about as well as most
      folks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do think you ought to be careful. Don't you see, dear, I don't
      want you to get sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick, rats! I'm not a baby! I guess I ain't going to get sick just because
      maybe once a week I shoot a highball! That's the trouble with women. They
      always exaggerate so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, I don't think you ought to talk that way when I'm just speaking
      for your own good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but gosh all fishhooks, that's the trouble with women! They're
      always criticizing and commenting and bringing things up, and then they
      say it's 'for your own good'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George, that's not a nice way to talk, to answer me so short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't mean to answer short, but gosh, talking as if I was a
      kindergarten brat, not able to tote one highball without calling for the
      St. Mary's ambulance! A fine idea you must have of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't that; it's just&mdash;I don't want to see you get sick and&mdash;My,
      I didn't know it was so late! Don't forget to give me those household
      accounts for the time while I was away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thunder, what's the use of taking the trouble to make 'em out now?
      Let's just skip 'em for that period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George Babbitt, in all the years we've been married we've never
      failed to keep a complete account of every penny we've spent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Maybe that's the trouble with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mean anything, only&mdash;Sometimes I get so darn sick and
      tired of all this routine and the accounting at the office and expenses at
      home and fussing and stewing and fretting and wearing myself out worrying
      over a lot of junk that doesn't really mean a doggone thing, and being so
      careful and&mdash;Good Lord, what do you think I'm made for? I could have
      been a darn good orator, and here I fuss and fret and worry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you suppose I ever get tired of fussing? I get so bored with
      ordering three meals a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, and
      ruining my eyes over that horrid sewing-machine, and looking after your
      clothes and Rone's and Ted's and Tinka's and everybody's, and the laundry,
      and darning socks, and going down to the Piggly Wiggly to market, and
      bringing my basket home to save money on the cash-and-carry and&mdash;EVERYTHING!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gosh,&rdquo; with a certain astonishment, &ldquo;I suppose maybe you do! But
      talk about&mdash;Here I have to be in the office every single day, while
      you can go out all afternoon and see folks and visit with the neighbors
      and do any blinkin' thing you want to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a fine lot of good that does me! Just talking over the same old
      things with the same old crowd, while you have all sorts of interesting
      people coming in to see you at the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting! Cranky old dames that want to know why I haven't rented
      their dear precious homes for about seven times their value, and bunch of
      old crabs panning the everlasting daylights out of me because they don't
      receive every cent of their rentals by three G.M. on the second of the
      month! Sure! Interesting! Just as interesting as the small pox!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, George, I will not have you shouting at me that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it gets my goat the way women figure out that a man doesn't do a
      darn thing but sit on his chair and have lovey-dovey conferences with a
      lot of classy dames and give 'em the glad eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you manage to give them a glad enough eye when they do come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Mean I'm chasing flappers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope not&mdash;at your age!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you look here! You may not believe it&mdash;Of course all you see is
      fat little Georgie Babbitt. Sure! Handy man around the house! Fixes the
      furnace when the furnace-man doesn't show up, and pays the bills, but
      dull, awful dull! Well, you may not believe it, but there's some women
      that think old George Babbitt isn't such a bad scout! They think he's not
      so bad-looking, not so bad that it hurts anyway, and he's got a pretty
      good line of guff, and some even think he shakes a darn wicked Walkover at
      dancing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She spoke slowly. &ldquo;I haven't much doubt that when I'm away you
      manage to find people who properly appreciate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I just mean&mdash;&rdquo; he protested, with a sound of denial. Then he
      was angered into semi-honesty. &ldquo;You bet I do! I find plenty of folks, and
      doggone nice ones, that don't think I'm a weak-stomached baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly what I was saying! You can run around with anybody you
      please, but I'm supposed to sit here and wait for you. You have the chance
      to get all sorts of culture and everything, and I just stay home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gosh almighty, there's nothing to prevent your reading books and
      going to lectures and all that junk, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, I told you, I won't have you shouting at me like that! I don't
      know what's come over you. You never used to speak to me in this cranky
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to sound cranky, but gosh, it certainly makes me sore to
      get the blame because you don't keep up with things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to! Will you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Anything I can do to help you in the culture-grabbing line&mdash;yours
      to oblige, G. F. Babbitt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, I want you to go to Mrs. Mudge's New Thought meeting with
      me, next Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Who's which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge. The field-lecturer for the American New Thought
      League. She's going to speak on 'Cultivating the Sun Spirit' before the
      League of the Higher Illumination, at the Thornleigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, punk! New Thought! Hashed thought with a poached egg! 'Cultivating
      the&mdash;' It sounds like 'Why is a mouse when it spins?' That's a fine
      spiel for a good Presbyterian to be going to, when you can hear Doc Drew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend Drew is a scholar and a pulpit orator and all that, but he
      hasn't got the Inner Ferment, as Mrs. Mudge calls it; he hasn't any
      inspiration for the New Era. Women need inspiration now. So I want you to
      come, as you promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zenith branch of the League of the Higher Illumination met in the
      smaller ballroom at the Hotel Thornleigh, a refined apartment with pale
      green walls and plaster wreaths of roses, refined parquet flooring, and
      ultra-refined frail gilt chairs. Here were gathered sixty-five women and
      ten men. Most of the men slouched in their chairs and wriggled, while
      their wives sat rigidly at attention, but two of them&mdash;red-necked,
      meaty men&mdash;were as respectably devout as their wives. They were newly
      rich contractors who, having bought houses, motors, hand-painted pictures,
      and gentlemanliness, were now buying a refined ready-made philosophy. It
      had been a toss-up with them whether to buy New Thought, Christian
      Science, or a good standard high-church model of Episcopalianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the flesh, Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge fell somewhat short of a prophetic
      aspect. She was pony-built and plump, with the face of a haughty
      Pekingese, a button of a nose, and arms so short that, despite her most
      indignant endeavors, she could not clasp her hands in front of her as she
      sat on the platform waiting. Her frock of taffeta and green velvet, with
      three strings of glass beads, and large folding eye-glasses dangling from
      a black ribbon, was a triumph of refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mudge was introduced by the president of the League of the Higher
      Illumination, an oldish young woman with a yearning voice, white spats,
      and a mustache. She said that Mrs. Mudge would now make it plain to the
      simplest intellect how the Sun Spirit could be cultivated, and they who
      had been thinking about cultivating one would do well to treasure Mrs.
      Mudge's words, because even Zenith (and everybody knew that Zenith stood
      in the van of spiritual and New Thought progress) didn't often have the
      opportunity to sit at the feet of such an inspiring Optimist and
      Metaphysical Seer as Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge, who had lived the Life of
      Wider Usefulness through Concentration, and in the Silence found those
      Secrets of Mental Control and the Inner Key which were immediately going
      to transform and bring Peace, Power, and Prosperity to the unhappy
      nations; and so, friends, would they for this precious gem-studded hour
      forget the Illusions of the Seeming Real, and in the actualization of the
      deep-lying Veritas pass, along with Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge, to the Realm
      Beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Mudge was rather pudgier than one would like one's swamis, yogis,
      seers, and initiates, yet her voice had the real professional note. It was
      refined and optimistic; it was overpoweringly calm; it flowed on
      relentlessly, without one comma, till Babbitt was hypnotized. Her favorite
      word was &ldquo;always,&rdquo; which she pronounced olllllle-ways. Her principal
      gesture was a pontifical but thoroughly ladylike blessing with two stubby
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained about this matter of Spiritual Saturation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are those&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of &ldquo;those&rdquo; she made a linked sweetness long drawn out; a far-off delicate
      call in a twilight minor. It chastely rebuked the restless husbands, yet
      brought them a message of healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are those who have seen the rim and outer seeming of the Logos
      there are those who have glimpsed and in enthusiasm possessed themselves
      of some segment and portion of the Logos there are those who thus flicked
      but not penetrated and radioactivated by the Dynamis go always to and fro
      assertative that they possess and are possessed of the Logos and the
      Metaphysikos but this word I bring you this concept I enlarge that those
      that are not utter are not even inceptive and that holiness is in its
      definitive essence always always always whole-iness and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It proved that the Essence of the Sun Spirit was Truth, but its Aura and
      Effluxion were Cheerfulness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Face always the day with the dawn-laugh with the enthusiasm of the
      initiate who perceives that all works together in the revolutions of the
      Wheel and who answers the strictures of the Soured Souls of the
      Destructionists with a Glad Affirmation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It went on for about an hour and seven minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end Mrs. Mudge spoke with more vigor and punctuation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let me suggest to all of you the advantages of the Theosophical and
      Pantheistic Oriental Reading Circle, which I represent. Our object is to
      unite all the manifestations of the New Era into one cohesive whole&mdash;New
      Thought, Christian Science, Theosophy, Vedanta, Bahaism, and the other
      sparks from the one New Light. The subscription is but ten dollars a year,
      and for this mere pittance the members receive not only the monthly
      magazine, Pearls of Healing, but the privilege of sending right to the
      president, our revered Mother Dobbs, any questions regarding spiritual
      progress, matrimonial problems, health and well-being questions, financial
      difficulties, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They listened to her with adoring attention. They looked genteel. They
      looked ironed-out. They coughed politely, and crossed their legs with
      quietness, and in expensive linen handkerchiefs they blew their noses with
      a delicacy altogether optimistic and refined.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Babbitt, he sat and suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were blessedly out in the air again, when they drove home
      through a wind smelling of snow and honest sun, he dared not speak. They
      had been too near to quarreling, these days. Mrs. Babbitt forced it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you enjoy Mrs. Mudge's talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I&mdash;What did you get out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it starts a person thinking. It gets you out of a routine of ordinary
      thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll hand it to Opal she isn't ordinary, but gosh&mdash;Honest, did
      that stuff mean anything to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm not trained in metaphysics, and there was lots I couldn't
      quite grasp, but I did feel it was inspiring. And she speaks so readily. I
      do think you ought to have got something out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't! I swear, I was simply astonished, the way those women
      lapped it up! Why the dickens they want to put in their time listening to
      all that blaa when they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's certainly better for them than going to roadhouses and smoking and
      drinking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether it is or not! Personally I don't see a whole lot of
      difference. In both cases they're trying to get away from themselves&mdash;most
      everybody is, these days, I guess. And I'd certainly get a whole lot more
      out of hoofing it in a good lively dance, even in some dive, than sitting
      looking as if my collar was too tight, and feeling too scared to spit, and
      listening to Opal chewing her words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you do! You're very fond of dives. No doubt you saw a lot of
      them while I was away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! You been doing a hell of a lot of insinuating and hinting
      around lately, as if I were leading a double life or something, and I'm
      damn sick of it, and I don't want to hear anything more about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George Babbitt! Do you realize what you're saying? Why, George, in
      all our years together you've never talked to me like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about time then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lately you've been getting worse and worse, and now, finally, you're
      cursing and swearing at me and shouting at me, and your voice so ugly and
      hateful&mdash;I just shudder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats, quit exaggerating! I wasn't shouting, or swearing either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could hear your own voice! Maybe you don't realize how it
      sounds. But even so&mdash;You never used to talk like that. You simply
      COULDN'T talk this way if something dreadful hadn't happened to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mind was hard. With amazement he found that he wasn't particularly
      sorry. It was only with an effort that he made himself more agreeable:
      &ldquo;Well, gosh, I didn't mean to get sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, do you realize that we can't go on like this, getting farther and
      farther apart, and you ruder and ruder to me? I just don't know what's
      going to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a moment's pity for her bewilderment; he thought of how many deep
      and tender things would be hurt if they really &ldquo;couldn't go on like this.&rdquo;
       But his pity was impersonal, and he was wondering, &ldquo;Wouldn't it maybe be a
      good thing if&mdash;Not a divorce and all that, o' course, but kind of a
      little more independence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she looked at him pleadingly he drove on in a dreadful silence.

      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      WHEN he was away from her, while he kicked about the garage and swept the
      snow off the running-board and examined a cracked hose-connection, he
      repented, he was alarmed and astonished that he could have flared out at
      his wife, and thought fondly how much more lasting she was than the
      flighty Bunch. He went in to mumble that he was &ldquo;sorry, didn't mean to be
      grouchy,&rdquo; and to inquire as to her interest in movies. But in the darkness
      of the movie theater he brooded that he'd &ldquo;gone and tied himself up to
      Myra all over again.&rdquo; He had some satisfaction in taking it out on Tanis
      Judique. &ldquo;Hang Tanis anyway! Why'd she gone and got him into these mix-ups
      and made him all jumpy and nervous and cranky? Too many complications! Cut
      'em out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted peace. For ten days he did not see Tanis nor telephone to her,
      and instantly she put upon him the compulsion which he hated. When he had
      stayed away from her for five days, hourly taking pride in his
      resoluteness and hourly picturing how greatly Tanis must miss him, Miss
      McGoun reported, &ldquo;Mrs. Judique on the 'phone. Like t' speak t' you 'bout
      some repairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tanis was quick and quiet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Babbitt? Oh, George, this is Tanis. I haven't seen you for weeks&mdash;days,
      anyway. You aren't sick, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, just been terribly rushed. I, uh, I think there'll be a big revival
      of building this year. Got to, uh, got to work hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, my man! I want you to. You know I'm terribly ambitious for
      you; much more than I am for myself. I just don't want you to forget poor
      Tanis. Will you call me up soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! Sure! You bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do. I sha'n't call you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meditated, &ldquo;Poor kid! . . . But gosh, she oughtn't to 'phone me at the
      office.... She's a wonder&mdash;sympathy 'ambitious for me.' . . . But
      gosh, I won't be made and compelled to call her up till I get ready. Darn
      these women, the way they make demands! It'll be one long old time before
      I see her! . . . But gosh, I'd like to see her to-night&mdash;sweet little
      thing.... Oh, cut that, son! Now you've broken away, be wise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not telephone again, nor he, but after five more days she wrote to
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I offended you? You must know, dear, I didn't mean to. I'm so lonely
      and I need somebody to cheer me up. Why didn't you come to the nice party
      we had at Carrie's last evening I remember she invited you. Can't you come
      around here to-morrow Thur evening? I shall be alone and hope to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reflections were numerous:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doggone it, why can't she let me alone? Why can't women ever learn a
      fellow hates to be bulldozed? And they always take advantage of you by
      yelling how lonely they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that isn't nice of you, young fella. She's a fine, square, straight
      girl, and she does get lonely. She writes a swell hand. Nice-looking
      stationery. Plain. Refined. I guess I'll have to go see her. Well, thank
      God, I got till to-morrow night free of her, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's nice but&mdash;Hang it, I won't be MADE to do things! I'm not
      married to her. No, nor by golly going to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats, I suppose I better go see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday, the to-morrow of Tanis's note, was full of emotional crises. At
      the Roughnecks' Table at the club, Verg Gunch talked of the Good Citizens'
      League and (it seemed to Babbitt) deliberately left him out of the
      invitations to join. Old Mat Penniman, the general utility man at
      Babbitt's office, had Troubles, and came in to groan about them: his
      oldest boy was &ldquo;no good,&rdquo; his wife was sick, and he had quarreled with his
      brother-in-law. Conrad Lyte also had Troubles, and since Lyte was one of
      his best clients, Babbitt had to listen to them. Mr. Lyte, it appeared,
      was suffering from a peculiarly interesting neuralgia, and the garage had
      overcharged him. When Babbitt came home, everybody had Troubles: his wife
      was simultaneously thinking about discharging the impudent new maid, and
      worried lest the maid leave; and Tinka desired to denounce her teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quit fussing!&rdquo; Babbitt fussed. &ldquo;You never hear me whining about my
      Troubles, and yet if you had to run a real-estate office&mdash;Why, to-day
      I found Miss Bannigan was two days behind with her accounts, and I pinched
      my finger in my desk, and Lyte was in and just as unreasonable as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so vexed that after dinner, when it was time for a tactful escape
      to Tanis, he merely grumped to his wife, &ldquo;Got to go out. Be back by
      eleven, should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You're going out again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again! What do you mean 'again'! Haven't hardly been out of the house for
      a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you going to the Elks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. Got to see some people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though this time he heard his own voice and knew that it was curt, though
      she was looking at him with wide-eyed reproach, he stumped into the hall,
      jerked on his ulster and furlined gloves, and went out to start the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was relieved to find Tanis cheerful, unreproachful, and brilliant in a
      frock of brown net over gold tissue. &ldquo;You poor man, having to come out on
      a night like this! It's terribly cold. Don't you think a small highball
      would be nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by golly, there's a woman with savvy! I think we could more or less
      stand a highball if it wasn't too long a one&mdash;not over a foot tall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her with careless heartiness, he forgot the compulsion of her
      demands, he stretched in a large chair and felt that he had beautifully
      come home. He was suddenly loquacious; he told her what a noble and
      misunderstood man he was, and how superior to Pete, Fulton Bemis, and the
      other men of their acquaintance; and she, bending forward, chin in
      charming hand, brightly agreed. But when he forced himself to ask, &ldquo;Well,
      honey, how's things with YOU,&rdquo; she took his duty-question seriously, and
      he discovered that she too had Troubles:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right but&mdash;I did get so angry with Carrie. She told Minnie
      that I told her that Minnie was an awful tightwad, and Minnie told me
      Carrie had told her, and of course I told her I hadn't said anything of
      the kind, and then Carrie found Minnie had told me, and she was simply
      furious because Minnie had told me, and of course I was just boiling
      because Carrie had told her I'd told her, and then we all met up at
      Fulton's&mdash;his wife is away&mdash;thank heavens!&mdash;oh, there's the
      dandiest floor in his house to dance on&mdash;and we were all of us simply
      furious at each other and&mdash;Oh, I do hate that kind of a mix-up, don't
      you? I mean&mdash;it's so lacking in refinement, but&mdash;And Mother
      wants to come and stay with me for a whole month, and of course I do love
      her, I suppose I do, but honestly, she'll cramp my style something
      dreadful&mdash;she never can learn not to comment, and she always wants to
      know where I'm going when I go out evenings, and if I lie to her she
      always spies around and ferrets around and finds out where I've been, and
      then she looks like Patience on a Monument till I could just scream. And
      oh, I MUST tell you&mdash;You know I never talk about myself; I just hate
      people who do, don't you? But&mdash;I feel so stupid to-night, and I know
      I must be boring you with all this but&mdash;What would you do about
      Mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her facile masculine advice. She was to put off her mother's stay.
      She was to tell Carrie to go to the deuce. For these valuable revelations
      she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch. Of
      what a sentimental fool was Carrie. Of what a lazy brat was Pete. Of how
      nice Fulton Bemis could be&mdash;&ldquo;course lots of people think he's a
      regular old grouch when they meet him because he doesn't give 'em the glad
      hand the first crack out of the box, but when they get to know him, he's a
      corker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as they had gone conscientiously through each of these analyses
      before, the conversation staggered. Babbitt tried to be intellectual and
      deal with General Topics. He said some thoroughly sound things about
      Disarmament, and broad-mindedness and liberalism; but it seemed to him
      that General Topics interested Tanis only when she could apply them to
      Pete, Carrie, or themselves. He was distressingly conscious of their
      silence. He tried to stir her into chattering again, but silence rose like
      a gray presence and hovered between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, uh&mdash;&rdquo; he labored. &ldquo;It strikes me&mdash;it strikes me that
      unemployment is lessening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe Pete will get a decent job, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperately he essayed, &ldquo;What's the trouble, old honey? You seem kind of
      quiet to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I? Oh, I'm not. But&mdash;do you really care whether I am or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care? Sure! Course I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really?&rdquo; She swooped on him, sat on the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated the emotional drain of having to appear fond of her. He stroked
      her hand, smiled up at her dutifully, and sank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, I wonder if you really like me at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I do, silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really, precious? Do you care a bit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why certainly! You don't suppose I'd be here if I didn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here, young man, I won't have you speaking to me in that huffy
      way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to sound huffy. I just&mdash;&rdquo; In injured and rather
      childish tones: &ldquo;Gosh almighty, it makes me tired the way everybody says I
      sound huffy when I just talk natural! Do they expect me to sing it or
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you mean by 'everybody'? How many other ladies have you been
      consoling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here now, I won't have this hinting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Humbly: &ldquo;I know, dear. I was only teasing. I know it didn't mean to talk
      huffy&mdash;it was just tired. Forgive bad Tanis. But say you love me, say
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you.... Course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do!&rdquo; cynically. &ldquo;Oh, darling, I don't mean to be rude but&mdash;I
      get so lonely. I feel so useless. Nobody needs me, nothing I can do for
      anybody. And you know, dear, I'm so active&mdash;I could be if there was
      something to do. And I am young, aren't I! I'm not an old thing! I'm not
      old and stupid, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to assure her. She stroked his hair, and he had to look pleased
      under that touch, the more demanding in its beguiling softness. He was
      impatient. He wanted to flee out to a hard, sure, unemotional man-world.
      Through her delicate and caressing fingers she may have caught something
      of his shrugging distaste. She left him&mdash;he was for the moment
      buoyantly relieved&mdash;she dragged a footstool to his feet and sat
      looking beseechingly up at him. But as in many men the cringing of a dog,
      the flinching of a frightened child, rouse not pity but a surprised and
      jerky cruelty, so her humility only annoyed him. And he saw her now as
      middle-aged, as beginning to be old. Even while he detested his own
      thoughts, they rode him. She was old, he winced. Old! He noted how the
      soft flesh was creasing into webby folds beneath her chin, below her eyes,
      at the base of her wrists. A patch of her throat had a minute roughness
      like the crumbs from a rubber eraser. Old! She was younger in years than
      himself, yet it was sickening to have her yearning up at him with rolling
      great eyes&mdash;as if, he shuddered, his own aunt were making love to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fretted inwardly, &ldquo;I'm through with this asinine fooling around. I'm
      going to cut her out. She's a darn decent nice woman, and I don't want to
      hurt her, but it'll hurt a lot less to cut her right out, like a good
      clean surgical operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on his feet. He was speaking urgently. By every rule of
      self-esteem, he had to prove to her, and to himself, that it was her
      fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose maybe I'm kind of out of sorts to-night, but honest, honey,
      when I stayed away for a while to catch up on work and everything and
      figure out where I was at, you ought to have been cannier and waited till
      I came back. Can't you see, dear, when you MADE me come, I&mdash;being
      about an average bull-headed chump&mdash;my tendency was to resist?
      Listen, dear, I'm going now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a while, precious! No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. Right now. And then sometime we'll see about the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, dear, 'about the future'? Have I done something I
      oughtn't to? Oh, I'm so dreadfully sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He resolutely put his hands behind him. &ldquo;Not a thing, God bless you, not a
      thing. You're as good as they make 'em. But it's just&mdash;Good Lord, do
      you realize I've got things to do in the world? I've got a business to
      attend to and, you might not believe it, but I've got a wife and kids that
      I'm awful fond of!&rdquo; Then only during the murder he was committing was he
      able to feel nobly virtuous. &ldquo;I want us to be friends but, gosh, I can't
      go on this way feeling I got to come up here every so often&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, darling, darling, and I've always told you, so carefully, that you
      were absolutely free. I just wanted you to come around when you were tired
      and wanted to talk to me, or when you could enjoy our parties&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so reasonable, she was so gently right! It took him an hour to
      make his escape, with nothing settled and everything horribly settled. In
      a barren freedom of icy Northern wind he sighed, &ldquo;Thank God that's over!
      Poor Tanis, poor darling decent Tanis! But it is over. Absolute! I'm
      free!&rdquo;

    <p>
      HIS wife was up when he came in. &ldquo;Did you have a good time?&rdquo; she sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not. I had a rotten time! Anything else I got to explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, how can you speak like&mdash;Oh, I don't know what's come over
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, there's nothing come over me! Why do you look for trouble all
      the time?&rdquo; He was warning himself, &ldquo;Careful! Stop being so disagreeable.
      Course she feels it, being left alone here all evening.&rdquo; But he forgot his
      warning as she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go out and see all sorts of strange people? I suppose you'll
      say you've been to another committee-meeting this evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. I've been calling on a woman. We sat by the fire and kidded each
      other and had a whale of a good time, if you want to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;From the way you say it, I suppose it's my fault you went
      there! I probably sent you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hate 'strange people' as you call 'em. If you had your way, I'd be as
      much of an old stick-in-the-mud as Howard Littlefield. You never want to
      have anybody with any git to 'em at the house; you want a bunch of old
      stiffs that sit around and gas about the weather. You're doing your level
      best to make me old. Well, let me tell you, I'm not going to have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overwhelmed she bent to his unprecedented tirade, and in answer she
      mourned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dearest, I don't think that's true. I don't mean to make you old, I
      know. Perhaps you're partly right. Perhaps I am slow about getting
      acquainted with new people. But when you think of all the dear good times
      we have, and the supper-parties and the movies and all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With true masculine wiles he not only convinced himself that she had
      injured him but, by the loudness of his voice and the brutality of his
      attack, he convinced her also, and presently he had her apologizing for
      his having spent the evening with Tanis. He went up to bed well pleased,
      not only the master but the martyr of the household. For a distasteful
      moment after he had lain down he wondered if he had been altogether just.
      &ldquo;Ought to be ashamed, bullying her. Maybe there is her side to things.
      Maybe she hasn't had such a bloomin' hectic time herself. But I don't
      care! Good for her to get waked up a little. And I'm going to keep free.
      Of her and Tanis and the fellows at the club and everybody. I'm going to
      run my own life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mood he was particularly objectionable at the Boosters' Club lunch
      next day. They were addressed by a congressman who had just returned from
      an exhaustive three-months study of the finances, ethnology, political
      systems, linguistic divisions, mineral resources, and agriculture of
      Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia,
      Jugoslavia, and Bulgaria. He told them all about those subjects, together
      with three funny stories about European misconceptions of America and some
      spirited words on the necessity of keeping ignorant foreigners out of
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, that was a mighty informative talk. Real he-stuff,&rdquo; said Sidney
      Finkelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the disaffected Babbitt grumbled, &ldquo;Four-flusher! Bunch of hot air! And
      what's the matter with the immigrants? Gosh, they aren't all ignorant, and
      I got a hunch we're all descended from immigrants ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you make me tired!&rdquo; said Mr. Finkelstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was aware that Dr. A. I. Dilling was sternly listening from across
      the table. Dr. Dilling was one of the most important men in the Boosters'.
      He was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and sounding
      occupation. He was an intense large man with a boiling of black hair and a
      thick black mustache. The newspapers often chronicled his operations; he
      was professor of surgery in the State University; he went to dinner at the
      very best houses on Royal Ridge; and he was said to be worth several
      hundred thousand dollars. It was dismaying to Babbitt to have such a
      person glower at him. He hastily praised the congressman's wit, to Sidney
      Finkelstein, but for Dr. Dilling's benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon three men shouldered into Babbitt's office with the air of
      a Vigilante committee in frontier days. They were large, resolute,
      big-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of Zenith&mdash;Dr.
      Dilling the surgeon, Charles McKelvey the contractor, and, most dismaying
      of all, the white-bearded Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of the
      Advocate-Times. In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and
      insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'n I do for you?&rdquo; he
      babbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They neither sat nor offered observations on the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babbitt,&rdquo; said Colonel Snow, &ldquo;we've come from the Good Citizens' League.
      We've decided we want you to join. Vergil Gunch says you don't care to,
      but I think we can show you a new light. The League is going to combine
      with the Chamber of Commerce in a campaign for the Open Shop, so it's time
      for you to put your name down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his embarrassment Babbitt could not recall his reasons for not wishing
      to join the League, if indeed he had ever definitely known them, but he
      was passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the thought
      of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even these
      princes of commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, Colonel, have to think it over a little,&rdquo; he mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKelvey snarled, &ldquo;That means you're not going to join, George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from Babbitt: &ldquo;Now, you
      look here, Charley! I'm damned if I'm going to be bullied into joining
      anything, not even by you plutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're not bullying anybody,&rdquo; Dr. Dilling began, but Colonel Snow thrust
      him aside with, &ldquo;Certainly we are! We don't mind a little bullying, if
      it's necessary. Babbitt, the G.C.L. has been talking about you a good
      deal. You're supposed to be a sensible, clean, responsible man; you always
      have been; but here lately, for God knows what reason, I hear from all
      sorts of sources that you're running around with a loose crowd, and what's
      a whole lot worse, you've actually been advocating and supporting some of
      the most dangerous elements in town, like this fellow Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel, that strikes me as my private business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, but we want to have an understanding. You've stood in, you and
      your father-in-law, with some of the most substantial and forward-looking
      interests in town, like my friends of the Street Traction Company, and my
      papers have given you a lot of boosts. Well, you can't expect the decent
      citizens to go on aiding you if you intend to side with precisely the
      people who are trying to undermine us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was frightened, but he had an agonized instinct that if he yielded
      in this he would yield in everything. He protested:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're exaggerating, Colonel. I believe in being broad-minded and
      liberal, but, of course, I'm just as much agin the cranks and
      blatherskites and labor unions and so on as you are. But fact is, I belong
      to so many organizations now that I can't do 'em justice, and I want to
      think it over before I decide about coming into the G.C.L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Snow condescended, &ldquo;Oh, no, I'm not exaggerating! Why the doctor
      here heard you cussing out and defaming one of the finest types of
      Republican congressmen, just this noon! And you have entirely the wrong
      idea about 'thinking over joining.' We're not begging you to join the
      G.C.L.&mdash;we're permitting you to join. I'm not sure, my boy, but what
      if you put it off it'll be too late. I'm not sure we'll want you then.
      Better think quick&mdash;better think quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three Vigilantes, formidable in their righteousness, stared at him in
      a taut silence. Babbitt waited through. He thought nothing at all, he
      merely waited, while in his echoing head buzzed, &ldquo;I don't want to join&mdash;I
      don't want to join&mdash;I don't want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Sorry for you!&rdquo; said Colonel Snow, and the three men abruptly
      turned their beefy backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      As Babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw Vergil Gunch coming
      down the block. He raised his hand in salutation, but Gunch ignored it and
      crossed the street. He was certain that Gunch had seen him. He drove home
      in sharp discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife attacked at once: &ldquo;Georgie dear, Muriel Frink was in this
      afternoon, and she says that Chum says the committee of this Good
      Citizens' League especially asked you to join and you wouldn't. Don't you
      think it would be better? You know all the nicest people belong, and the
      League stands for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what the League stands for! It stands for the suppression of free
      speech and free thought and everything else! I don't propose to be bullied
      and rushed into joining anything, and it isn't a question of whether it's
      a good league or a bad league or what the hell kind of a league it is;
      it's just a question of my refusing to be told I got to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dear, if you don't join, people might criticize you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em criticize!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean NICE people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats, I&mdash;Matter of fact, this whole League is just a fad. It's like
      all these other organizations that start off with such a rush and let on
      they're going to change the whole works, and pretty soon they peter out
      and everybody forgets all about 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it's THE fad now, don't you think you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't! Oh, Myra, please quit nagging me about it. I'm sick of
      hearing about the confounded G.C.L. I almost wish I'd joined it when Verg
      first came around, and got it over. And maybe I'd 've come in to-day if
      the committee hadn't tried to bullyrag me, but, by God, as long as I'm a
      free-born independent American cit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, George, you're talking exactly like the German furnace-man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am, am I! Then, I won't talk at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He longed, that evening, to see Tanis Judique, to be strengthened by her
      sympathy. When all the family were up-stairs he got as far as telephoning
      to her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and when the janitor
      answered he blurted, &ldquo;Nev' mind&mdash;I'll call later,&rdquo; and hung up the
      receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      If Babbitt had not been certain about Vergil Gunch's avoiding him, there
      could be little doubt about William Washington Eathorne, next morning.
      When Babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook Eathorne's car,
      with the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his chauffeur.
      Babbitt waved and cried, &ldquo;Mornin'!&rdquo; Eathorne looked at him deliberately,
      hesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's partner and father-in-law came in at ten:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, what's this I hear about some song and dance you gave Colonel
      Snow about not wanting to join the G.C.L.? What the dickens you trying to
      do? Wreck the firm? You don't suppose these Big Guns will stand your
      bucking them and springing all this 'liberal' poppycock you been getting
      off lately, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats, Henry T., you been reading bum fiction. There ain't any such a
      thing as these plots to keep folks from being liberal. This is a free
      country. A man can do anything he wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course th' ain't any plots. Who said they was? Only if folks get an idea
      you're scatter-brained and unstable, you don't suppose they'll want to do
      business with you, do you? One little rumor about your being a crank would
      do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff that these fool
      story-writers could think up in a month of Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, when the old reliable Conrad Lyte, the merry miser, Conrad
      Lyte, appeared, and Babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land in the
      new residential section of Dorchester, Lyte said hastily, too hastily,
      &ldquo;No, no, don't want to go into anything new just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later Babbitt learned, through Henry Thompson, that the officials
      of the Street Traction Company were planning another real-estate coup, and
      that Sanders, Torrey and Wing, not the Babbitt-Thompson Company, were to
      handle it for them. &ldquo;I figure that Jake Offutt is kind of leery about the
      way folks are talking about you. Of course Jake is a rock-ribbed old
      die-hard, and he probably advised the Traction fellows to get some other
      broker. George, you got to do something!&rdquo; trembled Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in a rush, Babbitt agreed. All nonsense the way people misjudged him,
      but still&mdash;He determined to join the Good Citizens' League the next
      time he was asked, and in furious resignation he waited. He wasn't asked.
      They ignored him. He did not have the courage to go to the League and beg
      in, and he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had &ldquo;gotten away with
      bucking the whole city. Nobody could dictate to him how he was going to
      think and act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was jarred as by nothing else when the paragon of stenographers, Miss
      McGoun, suddenly left him, though her reasons were excellent&mdash;she
      needed a rest, her sister was sick, she might not do any more work for six
      months. He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss
      Havstad's given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed
      improbable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a
      digestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede,
      that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat
      hash. She was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought, each
      evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her too-slim,
      too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her typing was
      perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with her. She made
      him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she looked gently
      inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return, and thought of writing to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard that Miss McGoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over to
      his dangerous competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not merely annoyed; he was frightened. &ldquo;Why did she quit, then?&rdquo; he
      worried. &ldquo;Did she have a hunch my business is going on the rocks? And it
      was Sanders got the Street Traction deal. Rats&mdash;sinking ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gray fear loomed always by him now. He watched Fritz Weilinger, the young
      salesman, and wondered if he too would leave. Daily he fancied slights. He
      noted that he was not asked to speak at the annual Chamber of Commerce
      dinner. When Orville Jones gave a large poker party and he was not
      invited, he was certain that he had been snubbed. He was afraid to go to
      lunch at the Athletic Club, and afraid not to go. He believed that he was
      spied on; that when he left the table they whispered about him. Everywhere
      he heard the rustling whispers: in the offices of clients, in the bank
      when he made a deposit, in his own office, in his own home. Interminably
      he wondered what They were saying of him. All day long in imaginary
      conversations he caught them marveling, &ldquo;Babbitt? Why, say, he's a regular
      anarchist! You got to admire the fellow for his nerve, the way he turned
      liberal and, by golly, just absolutely runs his life to suit himself, but
      say, he's dangerous, that's what he is, and he's got to be shown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so twitchy that when he rounded a corner and chanced on two
      acquaintances talking&mdash;whispering&mdash;his heart leaped, and he
      stalked by like an embarrassed schoolboy. When he saw his neighbors Howard
      Littlefield and Orville Jones together, he peered at them, went indoors to
      escape their spying, and was miserably certain that they had been
      whispering&mdash;plotting&mdash;whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all his fear ran defiance. He felt stubborn. Sometimes he decided
      that he had been a very devil of a fellow, as bold as Seneca Doane;
      sometimes he planned to call on Doane and tell him what a revolutionist he
      was, and never got beyond the planning. But just as often, when he heard
      the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed, &ldquo;Good Lord, what have I done?
      Just played with the Bunch, and called down Clarence Drum about being such
      a high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch ME criticizing people and trying to
      make them accept MY ideas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would like
      to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a decent
      and creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be forced
      back; he would not, he swore, &ldquo;eat dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears rise
      to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she couldn't
      understand why he did not want to &ldquo;drop in at the Littlefields'&rdquo; for the
      evening. He tried, but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of
      his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul and Tanis lost, he had no one
      to whom he could talk. &ldquo;Good Lord, Tinka is the only real friend I have,
      these days,&rdquo; he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with
      her all evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale curt
      note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis for
      whom he was longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need
      her, Lord how I need her!&rdquo; he raged. &ldquo;Myra simply can't understand. All
      she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But
      Tanis, she'd tell me I was all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not
      dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis.
      She was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like
      Tanis. She said, &ldquo;Yes, George, what is it?&rdquo; in even and uninterested
      tones, and he crept away, whipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      They danced in one evening when Ted was home from the university, and Ted
      chuckled, &ldquo;What's this I hear from Euny, dad? She says her dad says you
      raised Cain by boosting old Seneca Doane. Hot dog! Give 'em fits! Stir 'em
      up! This old burg is asleep!&rdquo; Eunice plumped down on Babbitt's lap, kissed
      him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed; &ldquo;I think you're
      lots nicer than Howard. Why is it,&rdquo; confidentially, &ldquo;that Howard is such
      an old grouch? The man has a good heart, and honestly, he's awfully
      bright, but he never will learn to step on the gas, after all the training
      I've given him. Don't you think we could do something with him, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eunice, that isn't a nice way to speak of your papa,&rdquo; Babbitt
      observed, in the best Floral Heights manner, but he was happy for the
      first time in weeks. He pictured himself as the veteran liberal
      strengthened by the loyalty of the young generation. They went out to
      rifle the ice-box. Babbitt gloated, &ldquo;If your mother caught us at this,
      we'd certainly get our come-uppance!&rdquo; and Eunice became maternal,
      scrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the ear,
      and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled, &ldquo;It beats the devil why
      feminists like me still go on nursing these men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus stimulated, Babbitt was reckless when he encountered Sheldon Smeeth,
      educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and choir-leader of the Chatham Road
      Church. With one of his damp hands Smeeth imprisoned Babbitt's thick paw
      while he chanted, &ldquo;Brother Babbitt, we haven't seen you at church very
      often lately. I know you're busy with a multitude of details, but you
      mustn't forget your dear friends at the old church home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt shook off the affectionate clasp&mdash;Sheldy liked to hold hands
      for a long time&mdash;and snarled, &ldquo;Well, I guess you fellows can run the
      show without me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G'day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But afterward he winced, &ldquo;If that white worm had the nerve to try to drag
      me back to the Old Church Home, then the holy outfit must have been doing
      a lot of talking about me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard them whispering&mdash;whispering&mdash;Dr. John Jennison Drew,
      Cholmondeley Frink, even William Washington Eathorne. The independence
      seeped out of him and he walked the streets alone, afraid of men's cynical
      eyes and the incessant hiss of whispering.

      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      HE tried to explain to his wife, as they prepared for bed, how
      objectionable was Sheldon Smeeth, but all her answer was, &ldquo;He has such a
      beautiful voice&mdash;so spiritual. I don't think you ought to speak of
      him like that just because you can't appreciate music!&rdquo; He saw her then as
      a stranger; he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman with the broad
      bare arms, and wondered how she had ever come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his chilly cot, turning from aching side to side, he pondered of Tanis.
      &ldquo;He'd been a fool to lose her. He had to have somebody he could really
      talk to. He'd&mdash;oh, he'd BUST if he went on stewing about things by
      himself. And Myra, useless to expect her to understand. Well, rats, no use
      dodging the issue. Darn shame for two married people to drift apart after
      all these years; darn rotten shame; but nothing could bring them together
      now, as long as he refused to let Zenith bully him into taking orders&mdash;and
      he was by golly not going to let anybody bully him into anything, or
      wheedle him or coax him either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He woke at three, roused by a passing motor, and struggled out of bed for
      a drink of water. As he passed through the bedroom he heard his wife
      groan. His resentment was night-blurred; he was solicitous in inquiring,
      &ldquo;What's the trouble, hon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got&mdash;such a pain down here in my side&mdash;oh, it's just&mdash;it
      tears at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad indigestion? Shall I get you some bicarb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think&mdash;that would help. I felt funny last evening and
      yesterday, and then&mdash;oh!&mdash;it passed away and I got to sleep and&mdash;That
      auto woke me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was laboring like a ship in a storm. He was alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I better call the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! It'll go away. But maybe you might get me an ice-bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked to the bathroom for the ice-bag, down to the kitchen for ice.
      He felt dramatic in this late-night expedition, but as he gouged the chunk
      of ice with the dagger-like pick he was cool, steady, mature; and the old
      friendliness was in his voice as he patted the ice-bag into place on her
      groin, rumbling, &ldquo;There, there, that'll be better now.&rdquo; He retired to bed,
      but he did not sleep. He heard her groan again. Instantly he was up,
      soothing her, &ldquo;Still pretty bad, honey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it just gripes me, and I can't get to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was faint. He knew her dread of doctors' verdicts and he did not
      inform her, but he creaked down-stairs, telephoned to Dr. Earl Patten, and
      waited, shivering, trying with fuzzy eyes to read a magazine, till he
      heard the doctor's car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was youngish and professionally breezy. He came in as though it
      were sunny noontime. &ldquo;Well, George, little trouble, eh? How is she now?&rdquo;
       he said busily as, with tremendous and rather irritating cheerfulness, he
      tossed his coat on a chair and warmed his hands at a radiator. He took
      charge of the house. Babbitt felt ousted and unimportant as he followed
      the doctor up to the bedroom, and it was the doctor who chuckled, &ldquo;Oh,
      just little stomach-ache&rdquo; when Verona peeped through her door, begging,
      &ldquo;What is it, Dad, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs. Babbitt the doctor said with amiable belligerence, after his
      examination, &ldquo;Kind of a bad old pain, eh? I'll give you something to make
      you sleep, and I think you'll feel better in the morning. I'll come in
      right after breakfast.&rdquo; But to Babbitt, lying in wait in the lower hall,
      the doctor sighed, &ldquo;I don't like the feeling there in her belly. There's
      some rigidity and some inflammation. She's never had her appendix out has
      she? Um. Well, no use worrying. I'll be here first thing in the morning,
      and meantime she'll get some rest. I've given her a hypo. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then was Babbitt caught up in the black tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the
      spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd
      before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and
      traditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and
      the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back to her.
      As she drowsed away in the tropic languor of morphia, he sat on the edge
      of her bed, holding her hand, and for the first time in many weeks her
      hand abode trustfully in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He draped himself grotesquely in his toweling bathrobe and a pink and
      white couch-cover, and sat lumpishly in a wing-chair. The bedroom was
      uncanny in its half-light, which turned the curtains to lurking robbers,
      the dressing-table to a turreted castle. It smelled of cosmetics, of
      linen, of sleep. He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times. He
      heard her move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn't some
      officious brisk thing he could do for her, and before he could quite form
      the thought he was asleep, racked and aching. The night was infinite. When
      dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end, he fell asleep, and was vexed
      to have been caught off his guard, to have been aroused by Verona's
      entrance and her agitated &ldquo;Oh, what is it, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was awake, her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light, but
      now he did not compare her with Tanis; she was not merely A Woman, to be
      contrasted with other women, but his own self, and though he might
      criticize her and nag her, it was only as he might criticize and nag
      himself, interestedly, unpatronizingly, without the expectation of
      changing&mdash;or any real desire to change&mdash;the eternal essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Verona he sounded fatherly again, and firm. He consoled Tinka, who
      satisfactorily pointed the excitement of the hour by wailing. He ordered
      early breakfast, and wanted to look at the newspaper, and felt somehow
      heroic and useful in not looking at it. But there were still crawling and
      totally unheroic hours of waiting before Dr. Patten returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't see much change,&rdquo; said Patten. &ldquo;I'll be back about eleven, and if
      you don't mind, I think I'll bring in some other world-famous pill-pedler
      for consultation, just to be on the safe side. Now George, there's nothing
      you can do. I'll have Verona keep the ice-bag filled&mdash;might as well
      leave that on, I guess&mdash;and you, you better beat it to the office
      instead of standing around her looking as if you were the patient. The
      nerve of husbands! Lot more neurotic than the women! They always have to
      horn in and get all the credit for feeling bad when their wives are
      ailing. Now have another nice cup of coffee and git!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under this derision Babbitt became more matter-of-fact. He drove to the
      office, tried to dictate letters, tried to telephone and, before the call
      was answered, forgot to whom he was telephoning. At a quarter after ten he
      returned home. As he left the down-town traffic and sped up the car, his
      face was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife greeted him with surprise. &ldquo;Why did you come back, dear? I think
      I feel a little better. I told Verona to skip off to her office. Was it
      wicked of me to go and get sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she wanted petting, and she got it, joyously. They were
      curiously happy when he heard Dr. Patten's car in front. He looked out of
      the window. He was frightened. With Patten was an impatient man with
      turbulent black hair and a hussar mustache&mdash;Dr. A. I. Dilling, the
      surgeon. Babbitt sputtered with anxiety, tried to conceal it, and hurried
      down to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Patten was profusely casual: &ldquo;Don't want to worry you, old man, but I
      thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her.&rdquo; He
      gestured toward Dilling as toward a master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs Babbitt tramped
      the living-room in agony. Except for his wife's confinements there had
      never been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery was at once
      a miracle and an abomination of fear. But when Dilling and Patten came
      down again he knew that everything was all right, and he wanted to laugh,
      for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded physicians in a musical
      comedy, both of them rubbing their hands and looking foolishly sagacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dilling spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, old man, but it's acute appendicitis. We ought to operate. Of
      course you must decide, but there's no question as to what has to be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt did not get all the force of it. He mumbled, &ldquo;Well I suppose we
      could get her ready in a couple o' days. Probably Ted ought to come down
      from the university, just in case anything happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dilling growled, &ldquo;Nope. If you don't want peritonitis to set in, we'll
      have to operate right away. I must advise it strongly. If you say go
      ahead, I'll 'phone for the St. Mary's ambulance at once, and we'll have
      her on the table in three-quarters of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I Of course, I suppose you know what&mdash;But great God, man, I
      can't get her clothes ready and everything in two seconds, you know! And
      in her state, so wrought-up and weak&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just throw her hair-brush and comb and tooth-brush in a bag; that's all
      she'll need for a day or two,&rdquo; said Dr. Dilling, and went to the
      telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He sent the frightened Tinka out
      of the room. He said gaily to his wife, &ldquo;Well, old thing, the doc thinks
      maybe we better have a little operation and get it over. Just take a few
      minutes&mdash;not half as serious as a confinement&mdash;and you'll be all
      right in a jiffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gripped his hand till the fingers ached. She said patiently, like a
      cowed child, &ldquo;I'm afraid&mdash;to go into the dark, all alone!&rdquo; Maturity
      was wiped from her eyes; they were pleading and terrified. &ldquo;Will you stay
      with me? Darling, you don't have to go to the office now, do you? Could
      you just go down to the hospital with me? Could you come see me this
      evening&mdash;if everything's all right? You won't have to go out this
      evening, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on his knees by the bed. While she feebly ruffled his hair, he
      sobbed, he kissed the lawn of her sleeve, and swore, &ldquo;Old honey, I love
      you more than anything in the world! I've kind of been worried by business
      and everything, but that's all over now, and I'm back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, maybe it would be a
      good thing if I just WENT. I was wondering if anybody really needed me. Or
      wanted me. I was wondering what was the use of my living. I've been
      getting so stupid and ugly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you old humbug! Fishing for compliments when I ought to be packing
      your bag! Me, sure, I'm young and handsome and a regular village cut-up
      and&mdash;&rdquo; He could not go on. He sobbed again; and in muttered
      incoherencies they found each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he packed, his brain was curiously clear and swift. He'd have no more
      wild evenings, he realized. He admitted that he would regret them. A
      little grimly he perceived that this had been his last despairing fling
      before the paralyzed contentment of middle-age. Well, and he grinned
      impishly, &ldquo;it was one doggone good party while it lasted!&rdquo; And&mdash;how
      much was the operation going to cost? &ldquo;I ought to have fought that out
      with Dilling. But no, damn it, I don't care how much it costs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motor ambulance was at the door. Even in his grief the Babbitt who
      admired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill with
      which the attendants slid Mrs. Babbitt upon a stretcher and carried her
      down-stairs. The ambulance was a huge, suave, varnished, white thing. Mrs.
      Babbitt moaned, &ldquo;It frightens me. It's just like a hearse, just like being
      put in a hearse. I want you to stay with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be right up front with the driver,&rdquo; Babbitt promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want you to stay inside with me.&rdquo; To the attendants: &ldquo;Can't he be
      inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, ma'am, you bet. There's a fine little camp-stool in there,&rdquo; the
      older attendant said, with professional pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot, its stool, its
      active little electric radiator, and its quite unexplained calendar,
      displaying a girl eating cherries, and the name of an enterprising grocer.
      But as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched the
      radiator, and he squealed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouch! Jesus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, George Babbitt, I won't have you cursing and swearing and
      blaspheming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, awful sorry but&mdash;Gosh all fish-hooks, look how I burned my
      hand! Gee whiz, it hurts! It hurts like the mischief! Why, that damn
      radiator is hot as&mdash;it's hot as&mdash;it's hotter 'n the hinges of
      Hades! Look! You can see the mark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, as they drove up to St. Mary's Hospital, with the nurses already
      laying out the instruments for an operation to save her life, it was she
      who consoled him and kissed the place to make it well, and though he tried
      to be gruff and mature, he yielded to her and was glad to be babied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambulance whirled under the hooded carriage-entrance of the hospital,
      and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare succession of
      cork-floored halls, endless doors open on old women sitting up in bed, an
      elevator, the anesthetizing room, a young interne contemptuous of
      husbands. He was permitted to kiss his wife; he saw a thin dark nurse fit
      the cone over her mouth and nose; he stiffened at a sweet and treacherous
      odor; then he was driven out, and on a high stool in a laboratory he sat
      dazed, longing to see her once again, to insist that he had always loved
      her, had never for a second loved anybody else or looked at anybody else.
      In the laboratory he was conscious only of a decayed object preserved in a
      bottle of yellowing alcohol. It made him very sick, but he could not take
      his eyes from it. He was more aware of it than of waiting. His mind
      floated in abeyance, coming back always to that horrible bottle. To escape
      it he opened the door to the right, hoping to find a sane and
      business-like office. He realized that he was looking into the
      operating-room; in one glance he took in Dr. Dilling, strange in white
      gown and bandaged head, bending over the steel table with its screws and
      wheels, then nurses holding basins and cotton sponges, and a swathed
      thing, just a lifeless chin and a mound of white in the midst of which was
      a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little bloody at the edges,
      protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like clinging parasites.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut the door with haste. It may be that his frightened repentance of
      the night and morning had not eaten in, but this dehumanizing interment of
      her who had been so pathetically human shook him utterly, and as he
      crouched again on the high stool in the laboratory he swore faith to his
      wife . . . to Zenith . . . to business efficiency . . . to the Boosters'
      Club . . . to every faith of the Clan of Good Fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a nurse was soothing, &ldquo;All over! Perfect success! She'll come out
      fine! She'll be out from under the anesthetic soon, and you can see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found her on a curious tilted bed, her face an unwholesome yellow but
      her purple lips moving slightly. Then only did he really believe that she
      was alive. She was muttering. He bent, and heard her sighing, &ldquo;Hard get
      real maple syrup for pancakes.&rdquo; He laughed inexhaustibly; he beamed on the
      nurse and proudly confided, &ldquo;Think of her talking about maple syrup! By
      golly, I'm going to go and order a hundred gallons of it, right from
      Vermont!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      She was out of the hospital in seventeen days. He went to see her each
      afternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. Once he
      hinted something of his relations to Tanis and the Bunch, and she was
      inflated by the view that a Wicked Woman had captivated her poor George.
    </p>
    <p>
      If once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the Good
      Fellows, he was convinced now. You didn't, he noted, &ldquo;see Seneca Doane
      coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the Missus,&rdquo;
       but Mrs. Howard Littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine
      jelly (flavored with real wine); Orville Jones spent hours in picking out
      the kind of novels Mrs. Babbitt liked&mdash;nice love stories about New
      York millionaries and Wyoming cowpunchers; Louetta Swanson knitted a pink
      bed-jacket; Sidney Finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of a wife
      selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of Parcher and Stein.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. At the
      Athletic Club they asked after her daily. Club members whose names he did
      not know stopped him to inquire, &ldquo;How's your good lady getting on?&rdquo;
       Babbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich
      warm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      One noon Vergil Gunch suggested, &ldquo;You planning to be at the hospital about
      six? The wife and I thought we'd drop in.&rdquo; They did drop in. Gunch was so
      humorous that Mrs. Babbitt said he must &ldquo;stop making her laugh because
      honestly it was hurting her incision.&rdquo; As they passed down the hall Gunch
      demanded amiably, &ldquo;George, old scout, you were soreheaded about something,
      here a while back. I don't know why, and it's none of my business. But you
      seem to be feeling all hunky-dory again, and why don't you come join us in
      the Good Citizens' League, old man? We have some corking times together,
      and we need your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then did Babbitt, almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of
      bullied, at being permitted to stop fighting, at being able to desert
      without injuring his opinion of himself, cease utterly to be a domestic
      revolutionist. He patted Gunch's shoulder, and next day he became a member
      of the Good Citizens' League.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two weeks no one in the League was more violent regarding the
      wickedness of Seneca Doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of
      immigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than
      was George F. Babbitt.

      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE Good Citizens' League had spread through the country, but nowhere was
      it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of Zenith,
      commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most of which&mdash;though
      not all&mdash;lay inland, against a background of cornfields and mines and
      of small towns which depended upon them for mortgage-loans, table-manners,
      art, social philosophy and millinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the League belonged most of the prosperous citizens of Zenith. They
      were not all of the kind who called themselves &ldquo;Regular Guys.&rdquo; Besides
      these hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the
      aristocrats, that is, the men who were richer or had been rich for more
      generations: the presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners,
      the corporation lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old
      men who worked not at all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith, collected
      luster-ware and first editions as though they were back in Paris. All of
      them agreed that the working-classes must be kept in their place; and all
      of them perceived that American Democracy did not imply any equality of
      wealth, but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought, dress, painting,
      morals, and vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this they were like the ruling-class of any other country, particularly
      of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous and in actually
      trying to produce the accepted standards which all classes, everywhere,
      desire, but usually despair of realizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longest struggle of the Good Citizens' League was against the Open
      Shop&mdash;which was secretly a struggle against all union labor.
      Accompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in
      English and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers,
      so that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and one
      hundred per cent. American way of settling labor-troubles was for workmen
      to trust and love their employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The League was more than generous in approving other organizations which
      agreed with its aims. It helped the Y.M. C.A. to raise a
      two-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. Babbitt, Vergil
      Gunch, Sidney Finkelstein, and even Charles McKelvey told the spectators
      at movie theaters how great an influence for manly Christianity the &ldquo;good
      old Y.&rdquo; had been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty Colonel
      Rutherford Snow, owner of the Advocate-Times, was photographed clasping
      the hand of Sheldon Smeeth of the Y.M.C.A. It is true that afterward, when
      Smeeth lisped, &ldquo;You must come to one of our prayer-meetings,&rdquo; the
      ferocious Colonel bellowed, &ldquo;What the hell would I do that for? I've got a
      bar of my own,&rdquo; but this did not appear in the public prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The League was of value to the American Legion at a time when certain of
      the lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of
      veterans of the Great War. One evening a number of young men raided the
      Zenith Socialist Headquarters, burned its records, beat the office staff,
      and agreeably dumped desks out of the window. All of the newspapers save
      the Advocate-Times and the Evening Advocate attributed this valuable but
      perhaps hasty direct-action to the American Legion. Then a flying squadron
      from the Good Citizens' League called on the unfair papers and explained
      that no ex-soldier could possibly do such a thing, and the editors saw the
      light, and retained their advertising. When Zenith's lone Conscientious
      Objector came home from prison and was righteously run out of town, the
      newspapers referred to the perpetrators as an &ldquo;unidentified mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the activities and triumphs of the Good Citizens' League Babbitt
      took part, and completely won back to self-respect, placidity, and the
      affection of his friends. But he began to protest, &ldquo;Gosh, I've done my
      share in cleaning up the city. I want to tend to business. Think I'll just
      kind of slacken up on this G.C.L. stuff now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had returned to the church as he had returned to the Boosters' Club. He
      had even endured the lavish greeting which Sheldon Smeeth gave him. He was
      worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his salvation. He
      was not quite sure there was a Heaven to be attained, but Dr. John
      Jennison Drew said there was, and Babbitt was not going to take a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when he was walking past Dr. Drew's parsonage he impulsively
      went in and found the pastor in his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jus' minute&mdash;getting 'phone call,&rdquo; said Dr. Drew in businesslike
      tones, then, aggressively, to the telephone: &ldquo;'Lo&mdash;'lo! This Berkey
      and Hannis? Reverend Drew speaking. Where the dickens is the proof for
      next Sunday's calendar? Huh? Y' ought to have it here. Well, I can't help
      it if they're ALL sick! I got to have it to-night. Get an A.D.T. boy and
      shoot it up here quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, without slackening his briskness. &ldquo;Well, Brother Babbitt, what
      c'n I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to ask&mdash;Tell you how it is, dominie: Here a while ago
      I guess I got kind of slack. Took a few drinks and so on. What I wanted to
      ask is: How is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his
      senses? Does it sort of, well, you might say, does it score against him in
      the long run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Dr. Drew was suddenly interested. &ldquo;And, uh, brother&mdash;the
      other things, too? Women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, practically, you might say, practically not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't hesitate to tell me, brother! That's what I'm here for. Been going
      on joy-rides? Squeezing girls in cars?&rdquo; The reverend eyes glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you. I've got a deputation from the Don't Make
      Prohibition a Joke Association coming to see me in a quarter of an hour,
      and one from the Anti-Birth-Control Union at a quarter of ten.&rdquo; He busily
      glanced at his watch. &ldquo;But I can take five minutes off and pray with you.
      Kneel right down by your chair, brother. Don't be ashamed to seek the
      guidance of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt's scalp itched and he longed to flee, but Dr. Drew had already
      flopped down beside his desk-chair and his voice had changed from rasping
      efficiency to an unctuous familiarity with sin and with the Almighty.
      Babbitt also knelt, while Drew gloated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, thou seest our brother here, who has been led astray by manifold
      temptations. O Heavenly Father, make his heart to be pure, as pure as a
      little child's. Oh, let him know again the joy of a manly courage to
      abstain from evil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheldon Smeeth came frolicking into the study. At the sight of the two men
      he smirked, forgivingly patted Babbitt on the shoulder, and knelt beside
      him, his arm about him, while he authorized Dr. Drew's imprecations with
      moans of &ldquo;Yes, Lord! Help our brother, Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though he was trying to keep his eyes closed, Babbitt squinted between his
      fingers and saw the pastor glance at his watch as he concluded with a
      triumphant, &ldquo;And let him never be afraid to come to Us for counsel and
      tender care, and let him know that the church can lead him as a little
      lamb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Drew sprang up, rolled his eyes in the general direction of Heaven,
      chucked his watch into his pocket, and demanded, &ldquo;Has the deputation come
      yet, Sheldy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep, right outside,&rdquo; Sheldy answered, with equal liveliness; then,
      caressingly, to Babbitt, &ldquo;Brother, if it would help, I'd love to go into
      the next room and pray with you while Dr. Drew is receiving the brothers
      from the Don't Make Prohibition a Joke Association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no thanks&mdash;can't take the time!&rdquo; yelped Babbitt, rushing
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter he was often seen at the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church, but
      it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      If his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not quite
      dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the Good Citizens' League nor
      quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of the joy with
      which Babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of the Athletic
      Club, the Boosters, the Elks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verona and Kenneth Escott were eventually and hesitatingly married. For
      the wedding Babbitt was dressed as carefully as was Verona; he was crammed
      into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a certain
      relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine, he
      returned to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching feet
      up on the davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have the
      living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and
      Kenneth worrying, in a cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages and
      the Drama League.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even this sinking into peace was less consoling than his return to
      being one of the best-loved men in the Boosters' Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      President Willis Ijams began that Boosters' Club luncheon by standing
      quiet and staring at them so unhappily that they feared he was about to
      announce the death of a Brother Booster. He spoke slowly then, and
      gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I have something shocking to reveal to you; something terrible
      about one of our own members.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several Boosters, including Babbitt, looked disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A knight of the grip, a trusted friend of mine, recently made a trip
      up-state, and in a certain town, where a certain Booster spent his
      boyhood, he found out something which can no longer be concealed. In fact,
      he discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as a Real
      Guy and as one of us. Gentlemen, I cannot trust my voice to say it, so I
      have written it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uncovered a large blackboard and on it, in huge capitals, was the
      legend:
    </p>
    <p>
      George Follansbee Babbitt&mdash;oh you Folly!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boosters cheered, they laughed, they wept, they threw rolls at
      Babbitt, they cried, &ldquo;Speech, speech! Oh you Folly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      President Ijams continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, gentlemen, is the awful thing Georgie Babbitt has been concealing
      all these years, when we thought he was just plain George F. Now I want
      you to tell us, taking it in turn, what you've always supposed the F.
      stood for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flivver, they suggested, and Frog-face and Flathead and Farinaceous and
      Freezone and Flapdoodle and Foghorn. By the joviality of their insults
      Babbitt knew that he had been taken back to their hearts, and happily he
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I've got to admit it. I've never worn a wrist-watch, or parted my
      name in the middle, but I will confess to 'Follansbee.' My only
      justification is that my old dad&mdash;though otherwise he was perfectly
      sane, and packed an awful wallop when it came to trimming the City Fellers
      at checkers&mdash;named me after the family doc, old Dr. Ambrose
      Follansbee. I apologize, boys. In my next what-d'you-call-it I'll see to
      it that I get named something really practical&mdash;something that sounds
      swell and yet is good and virile&mdash;something, in fact, like that grand
      old name so familiar to every household&mdash;that bold and almost
      overpowering name, Willis Jimjams Ijams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular; he knew that he
      would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from the
      Clan of Good Fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Thompson dashed into the office, clamoring, &ldquo;George! Big news! Jake
      Offutt says the Traction Bunch are dissatisfied with the way Sanders,
      Torrey and Wing handled their last deal, and they're willing to dicker
      with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his rebellion
      was healed, yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such background
      thoughts as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent conformity.
      He discovered that he actually did not consider the Traction group quite
      honest. &ldquo;Well, he'd carry out one more deal for them, but as soon as it
      was practicable, maybe as soon as old Henry Thompson died, he'd break away
      from all association from them. He was forty-eight; in twelve years he'd
      be sixty; he wanted to leave a clean business to his grandchildren. Course
      there was a lot of money in negotiating for the Traction people, and a
      fellow had to look at things in a practical way, only&mdash;&rdquo; He wriggled
      uncomfortably. He wanted to tell the Traction group what he thought of
      them. &ldquo;Oh, he couldn't do it, not now. If he offended them this second
      time, they would crush him. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious that his line of progress seemed confused. He wondered
      what he would do with his future. He was still young; was he through with
      all adventuring? He felt that he had been trapped into the very net from
      which he had with such fury escaped and, supremest jest of all, been made
      to rejoice in the trapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've licked me; licked me to a finish!&rdquo; he whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was peaceful, that evening, and he enjoyed a game of pinochle
      with his wife. He indignantly told the Tempter that he was content to do
      things in the good old fashioned way. The day after, he went to see the
      purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company and they made plans for
      the secret purchase of lots along the Evanston Road. But as he drove to
      his office he struggled, &ldquo;I'm going to run things and figure out things to
      suit myself&mdash;when I retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted had come down from the University for the week-end. Though he no
      longer spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was reticent about
      his opinion of his instructors, he seemed no more reconciled to college,
      and his chief interest was his wireless telephone set.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday evening he took Eunice Littlefield to a dance at Devon Woods.
      Babbitt had a glimpse of her, bouncing in the seat of the car, brilliant
      in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk. They two had not
      returned when the Babbitts went to bed, at half-past eleven. At a blurred
      indefinite time of late night Babbitt was awakened by the ring of the
      telephone and gloomily crawled down-stairs. Howard Littlefield was
      speaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, Euny isn't back yet. Is Ted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;at least his door is open&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to be home. Eunice said the dance would be over at midnight.
      What's the name of those people where they're going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, gosh, tell the truth, I don't know, Howard. It's some classmate of
      Ted's, out in Devon Woods. Don't see what we can do. Wait, I'll skip up
      and ask Myra if she knows their name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbitt turned on the light in Ted's room. It was a brown boyish room;
      disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of
      basket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Babbitt, awakened, irritably observed that she certainly did not know
      the name of Ted's host, that it was late, that Howard Littlefield was but
      little better than a born fool, and that she was sleepy. But she remained
      awake and worrying while Babbitt, on the sleeping-porch, struggled back
      into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her remarks. It was after
      dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and calling &ldquo;George! George!&rdquo;
       in something like horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here quick and see. Be quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him down the hall to the door of Ted's room and pushed it gently
      open. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon
      lingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the
      pillows were two sleepy heads&mdash;Ted's and Eunice's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted woke to grin, and to mutter with unconvincing defiance, &ldquo;Good morning!
      Let me introduce my wife&mdash;Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Eunice Littlefield
      Babbitt, Esquiress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; from Babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, &ldquo;You've gone
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got married last evening. Wife! Sit up and say a pretty good morning
      to mother-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nine o'clock the assembly which was gathered about Ted and Eunice in
      the living-room included Mr. and Mrs. George Babbitt, Dr. and Mrs. Howard
      Littlefield, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Escott, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Thompson,
      and Tinka Babbitt, who was the only pleased member of the inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crackling shower of phrases filled the room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At their age&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ought to be annulled&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Never heard of such a
      thing in&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Fault of both of them and&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Keep it out of the
      papers&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ought to be packed off to school&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Do something
      about it at once, and what I say is&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Damn good old-fashioned
      spanking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Worst of them all was Verona. &ldquo;TED! Some way MUST be found to make you
      understand how dreadfully SERIOUS this is, instead of standing AROUND with
      that silly foolish SMILE on your face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to revolt. &ldquo;Gee whittakers, Rone, you got married yourself,
      didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's entirely different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it is! They didn't have to work on Eu and me with a chain and
      tackle to get us to hold hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, young man, we'll have no more flippancy,&rdquo; old Henry Thompson
      ordered. &ldquo;You listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You listen to Grandfather!&rdquo; said Verona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, listen to your Grandfather!&rdquo; said Mrs. Babbitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ted, you listen to Mr. Thompson!&rdquo; said Howard Littlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for the love o' Mike, I am listening!&rdquo; Ted shouted. &ldquo;But you look
      here, all of you! I'm getting sick and tired of being the corpse in this
      post mortem! If you want to kill somebody, go kill the preacher that
      married us! Why, he stung me five dollars, and all the money I had in the
      world was six dollars and two bits. I'm getting just about enough of being
      hollered at!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A new voice, booming, authoritative, dominated the room. It was Babbitt.
      &ldquo;Yuh, there's too darn many putting in their oar! Rone, you dry up. Howard
      and I are still pretty strong, and able to do our own cussing. Ted, come
      into the dining-room and we'll talk this over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room, the door firmly closed, Babbitt walked to his son, put
      both hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;You're more or less right. They all talk too
      much. Now what do you plan to do, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, dad, are you really going to be human?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;Remember one time you called us 'the Babbitt men' and said
      we ought to stick together? I want to. I don't pretend to think this isn't
      serious. The way the cards are stacked against a young fellow to-day, I
      can't say I approve of early marriages. But you couldn't have married a
      better girl than Eunice; and way I figure it, Littlefield is darn lucky to
      get a Babbitt for a son-in-law! But what do you plan to do? Course you
      could go right ahead with the U., and when you'd finished&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, I can't stand it any more. Maybe it's all right for some fellows.
      Maybe I'll want to go back some day. But me, I want to get into mechanics.
      I think I'd get to be a good inventor. There's a fellow that would give me
      twenty dollars a week in a factory right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Babbitt crossed the floor, slowly, ponderously, seeming a
      little old. &ldquo;I've always wanted you to have a college degree.&rdquo; He
      meditatively stamped across the floor again. &ldquo;But I've never&mdash;Now,
      for heaven's sake, don't repeat this to your mother, or she'd remove what
      little hair I've got left, but practically, I've never done a single thing
      I've wanted to in my whole life! I don't know 's I've accomplished
      anything except just get along. I figure out I've made about a quarter of
      an inch out of a possible hundred rods. Well, maybe you'll carry things on
      further. I don't know. But I do get a kind of sneaking pleasure out of the
      fact that you knew what you wanted to do and did it. Well, those folks in
      there will try to bully you, and tame you down. Tell 'em to go to the
      devil! I'll back you. Take your factory job, if you want to. Don't be
      scared of the family. No, nor all of Zenith. Nor of yourself, the way I've
      been. Go ahead, old man! The world is yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arms about each other's shoulders, the Babbitt men marched into the
      living-room and faced the swooping family.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
